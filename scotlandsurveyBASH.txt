38 ARGYLGSHIUE. in lieu of his claim. â€¢ The manse of the minister of the Gaelic congregation is old, small, and not in good repair, situated in the burgh ; the manse of the lowland charge was built in 1842, to the west of the burgh, and is both a commodious and handsome building. The amount of the stipends is as follows: 1. Gaelic or parochial charge^ â€” 110 bolls 3 Brlots 2 pecks of oatmeal, of 140 lbs. per boll ; money stipend, L.1 1, Os. 6d. ; al* lowance for glebe, L.40 ; for grassmail and hay, L.5; for com- munion elements, L.d, 6s. 8d. ; from Exchequer, L.54, 5s. 4d. 2. Enffliah or burgh charge^ â€” 30f bolls oatmeal, of 140 lbs. per boll; money stipend, L.1, 10s. 6^Â§d. ; from Exchequer, L.127, 8s. lOd. ; ditto in lieu of glebe, L.d0; communion ele* ments, L.d, 6s. 8d. The only chapel in the parish is in connection with the United Associate Synod, and the minister officiating is supported wholly or principally by a congregation of that body in Glasgow. The number of individuals in the parish belonging to any class * Dr Fraser obtained a small farm from the late Duke and his father At a no- minal rent, instead of Bervitude, and the agents of the late Duke, when the writer l>ecame minister of the lowland congregation in 1828, informed him of the fact, but he declined to apply for it, as be considered it a grant rather than a right. t By the original establishment of this charge, it was distinct from the old parlrii* and the minister did not preach Gaelic. The stipend, also, was allocated by the Mar* quis of Argylc and others, Commissioners for the Plantation of Churches in Argyle- shire in 1651, from the revenues of the bishoprics of Lismore and the Isles, to the amount of three chalders of victual, two parts meal and one part bear, to be paid out of the firfit and readiest of the teinds of the I sle of Bute, and 900 merks to be paid out of the Arst and readiest of the surplus teinds of Kilbride, in Lorn, Kileolm.kil], Killintag, in Morven, the isles of Mull, Coll, and Tiree, &c These teinds had l)een previously granted to the Marquis of Argyle, and thus transferred by bitn. In 1705, the synod of Argyle obuined a grant of the vacant revenues of the bishoprics of Argyle and the Isles for pious uses; and though from 1651 downwards, the mi* nister of the second charge held the above modified stipend as a right, the synod seem to have considered these teinds granted to them, and to have continued it as a favour duwn to 1724, when the Crown granted the teinds of the Isle of Bute to the Earl of Bute, but without consent from Parliament. The synod acquiesced, and so did the minister thus deprived, till! 770, when a process was brought by the latter for the recovery of these three chalders thus granted and withheld. In that process, the pursuer maintained that bis stipend was modified by the Commissioners of Parlia- ment for Plantation of Churches in 1651, not distinguishing, however, between the high commission for that purpose, and the special commissioners, appointed by an unprintcd statute for Argyleshire. The High Commission did not sit in 1651, con- sequently sentence was given against the pursuer, on the ground that ^' the decreet of locality, if not a forgery, w;is a gross imposition.*' The 900 merks are not now paid to the minister of the second charge; but, in 1792, it was found that aevenl farms in Glenshira, reputed to belong to Locbgoilhead, pertained to Inverary. The Duke of Argyle brought a process of modification, craving these teinds for the two ministers, though, till then, the first minister alone was considered to have a right to the parish teinds. Contrary to the usual practice of the Court of Teinds in such cases, an liiterLwutor wus pronounced to that effect in 1792, and adhered to by the court in 1704. bv which each miuister received thirty Ik)11s of victual, and L.I5, IGs. 8d.

There are also two families of Baptists, and two feÂ« males in other two families* Eight families belong to the Seces* sion, and several individuals, making their numbers amount to 24 or 25. All the remaining population belong to the Establishment, The numbers attending stated ordinances in the Established churches are, on an average, about 700, the members of many families, among the population of the country and burgh also, going to church on alternate Sabbaths, or to alternate diets. The number of communicants in the Established Church varies from 600 to 630. The Secession chapel is well attended in the evenings by mem- bers of the Established Church. ^ The collections at the doors of the two parochial churches were, for the last four years, thus : 1839, L.86, 2s. ; 1840, L.129, ds. Id.; 1841, L.120, 13s.; and 1842, L.101, 15s. 7d. The amount collected during the same years for religious and charitable purposes was, in 1839, L.21, 13s. 4d.; 1840, L.22; 1841, L.26, 8s. 5id.; 1842, L.35, 6s. Id. Education. â€” The erection and maintenance of schools were ob- jects of careful attention to the early Presbyterian ministers of this county, and the records of the synod of Argyle state a unanimous resolution come to by that body in 1640, to erect and maintain schools at their own expense ; and their plan, when more fully developed, was, that there should be one good school in every pa- rish ; that the schools placed at the seats of presbyteries should be of a higher order, and maintained by the ministers and elders composing these presbyteries respectively ; that at Inverary there should be a grammar school, to which, as to a provincial seminary under the superintendence of a doctor, the youth might resort from all parts, within the bounds, for instruction in those branches which could not be taught so well in the parish schools. To maintain this head school, it was resolved that ^' ilk brother shall pay ten merks yearly." Two thousand merks of voluntary contribution were given in* 1648, for a foundation to it ; and, in 1649, the Marquis of Argyle mortified 600 merks yearly for its use. Several sums were afterwards mortified for the benefit of this school, by Campbell of Stonefield and others, to the amount * Records of the Synod of Argyle, Vol i. pages 161 and 199. Digitized by Google 40 AllGYLESHlRE. of L28d, 6s. 8d.

Sterling, being the price of teinds in the parish of Appin, purchased from the Duke of Argyle by Mr Seaton, then of Appin, and made payable by the Duke of Argyle to the burgh, for behoof of the grammar school. For many years, also, and until the teinds were evicted by a late augmentation of stipend, the tack-duty of the treasury teinds of the parish of Lismore were made payable by the Duke of Argyle to the town for behoof of the school. From these se- veral sources of revenue, the grammar school was supported ; and the scholars were so numerous, that, in the eighteenth century, application was made for permission to place all the children learning the elementary branches under the -charge of a second teacher, so that the other teacher might be at liberty to de- vote all his time to instruction in the higher departments. Id 1803, the second school thus formed became the parochial school, with the salary appointed by statute, and the teacher retained, and has since received the interest of the morti6ed sum of L.283, 6s. 8d. which were probably allowed him in consideration of the labour imposed on him as second teacher. The salaries of the two teachers at present are, â€” ] .

A fourth school is placed in Glenaray, four miles north of the burgh, supported by a salary of L.15 a-year from the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and by a free house, cow's grass, and money to the amount of L.15 from the Duke of Argyle. The fifth is a female school, four miles south*west of the burgh, supported by a salary of L..5 from the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and a free house from the Duke of Argyle. Five Sabbath schools are taught in the parish. Library, â€” A parochial library was formed in 1832, but the books are little read. The principal Sabbath school has also a juvenile library attached to it. Savings Bank* â€” A savings bank was established in 1829, and the present amount of the sums deposited is L.232, 19s.29d. Poor. â€” The poor of this parish are principally composed of fe- males, who have become unable, through years or ill health, to maintain themselves, with occasionally an old man, whom misfortune or misconduct has reduced to want Their numbers have ranged for many years from 46 to 56, according to the season of the year, the price of meal, or the difficulty of procuring labour. The ma- jority of these are always found in the burgh, where the system of letting or giving a single apartment to a family is favourable to their settlement In the rural district, for several years, the num- ber of paupers has ranged from 10 to 16, and they are always more easily satisfied, and make fewer demands on the session than such as live in the burgh. In addition to the collection at the church doors already mentioned, several sums of money have been at different times left to the poor, and placed at the disposal of the kirk-session. Much of the money thus left has been distri- buted among the indigent in times of pressing want, or lost Above L.260 still remain, bearing interest; and above L.100, lent out on personal security, bears no interest, and is either doubtful or lost The inhabitants are very charitable to the poor, and much money is given in alms, or collected by sales of work and penny* a- week subscriptions for their relief; but the principal source of their support is the Duke of Argyle, who, as sole heritor, never refuses or fails to give whatever is necessary for them. The amount given annually by the present Duke, whether in pensions, free- houses, meal, coals, soup-kitchen, or in sundry other ways, i Digitized by Google 42 ARQYLESHIRE. exceeds L.500. Notwithstanding all these means of supply to the poor, and their amount, destitution is frequent, and so also are complaints. The disposition to ask relief varies with the amount of the relief proposed or disposable. Pruofii, â€” The debtors' gaol consists of five apartments, and the criminal gaol was made with eight cells and one large hall, but was altered in 1841, and formed into ten cells. The expense of maintaining the improved management under which it has been pla- ced, has also increased from an average of L.60 per annum, the great proportion of which was defrayed by the burgh, to L. 180, Os. 9d. for 1841 ; and L. t2d8, 5s. 6d. for 1 842. It is proposed to make an addi- tional prison, to consist of twelve cells, the present number being found insufficient The average daily number of criminal prisoners for the year 1841* was 8269; in 1842, 11,663; and for the past four months of this year, 19Â§, or upwards, showing a great increase either of crime or of legal vigilance. The average cost of each prisoner was, in 1841, L.9, 15s. 4d.; and the average annual earning of each, 4.S. 2d.; in 1842, L.9, ds. lid.; and the average annual earning of each, L.3, 2s The gross profits arising from such la- hour was, in 1841, L.1, Ids. ; and, in 1842, L.25, 2s. 24d. The following statement shews the number of prisoners confin- ed in the prison of Inverary, and which serves for the whole county, with the nature of the crimes with which they were charged, from the 1st July 1840 to 1st September 1842. Certified return of prisoners confined in the prison of Inverary, with their classes and crimes from 1st July 1840 to Ist Sep* tember 1842.t Number of criminals, 246 ; debtors, 14 ; theft, 50 males, 20 fe* males; assault, 118 males, 15 females; vagrancy, 14 males, 12 females ; hawking, 1 male, 3 females ; murder, 2 males, 2 females ; violating sepulchre, 1 male, 2 females ; forgery, 1 male ; contempt of court, 1 do. ; crown witness, 1 do. : revenue prisoners, 8 do. In 1834, the total number of committals to the several gaols of Argyleshire was 66. In 1835, 50. It has been ascertained that nineteen out of twenty committals have arisen, during the last two years, from indulgence in iutoxicat* ing liquors. * See Fourth Report of the General Board of Directors of Prisons in Scotland, t Return by Malcohn Thomson, keeper of Inverary Prison, Digitized by Google INVERART. 43 Itms^ 8fc. â€” The number of inns in the parish is two ; of ale- houses and dram-shops, or shops licensed to sell spirits, &a, 12, all of which are in the burgh. Among these a great quantity of spirits is sold ; and the following statement shows the amount of gallons sold, exclusive of wine, porter, ales,' &c. in the last quarter of 1841 and the 6rst quarter of 1843. These quarters may be considered as the maximum and minimum for these years. Number of gallons of spirits sold or taken out of stock in Inve- rary, from 5th October 1841 to 5th January 1842, and from 5th January to 5th April 1843 :* â€” Last quarter of 1841, home spirits , 2525 gallons ; brandy, 46 ; foreign gin, 1 1 ; rum, 26 ; cordial, 96 ; total Tor the quarter, 2704.

Total for a year, 9802 gallons. It is difficult to conceive how such a quantity of spirits is con- sumed, or whence the money comes for paying it ; but it requires no exercise of credulity to believe that it cannot be used without much abuse of time, means, and understanding. Fuel. â€” The fuel used in the burgh is coal brought from Glas- gow, Ardrossan, and other places, and sold here at prices varying from l*2s. 6d. to 15s. 6d. per ton of 24 cwt. In the rural districts coal is also used by the principal farmers and gentlemen ; but turf or peat continues to be in general use. Miscellaneous Observations. Time has made its changes, its ravages, and improvements on this as on other parts of the country since 1792, when the last Statistical Account was written.

The cottages and farm-buildings are generally of a very inferior description, formed of stones without lime, and thatched with ferns or sprits. The consequence isy they only endure for a few years, require constant repairs, occupy the time of the tenant at the season in which he ought to be drain- ing and preparing his land, and by going into decay, require more timber every twenty years from the proprietor than would main- tain slated houses for generations. The fields are also for the most part undivided, and wrought in a slovenly manner, or are undrained and in the state of nature. Turnips are little used ; potatoes may be said to be the only green crop raised, and sown grasses are cultivated only by the higher order of tenantry, it being considered useless to attempt to grow such on land which is open and liable to be poached by cattle in all states of the weather, or soft and marshy, or so limited in quan- tity, that what is dry and healthy must be constantly under po- tatoes and corn. To remedy these and any other defects in hus- bandry, the surest means are to encourage and to improve the con* dition of the tenantry. It is only a few years since, that such en- couragement has been given to the tenant to drain or fence his lands. Now the proprietor encourages the tenants, by opening drains which they close, building dikes the stones of which they collect, and generally by paying a share of the work done ; so that, if the progress for the next twenty years shall prove equal to the improvements for the eight which have elapsed, all parties will be benefited, and the face of the country still further beautified. * This U delusive of the rents of the houses in town. Jufy 1843. Digitized by Google PARISH OF CRAIGNISH. FRE8BTTERT OF INVERARY, 8TNOD OF ARGTLE. THE REV. ARCHIBALD FRANCIS STEWART, MINISTER. L â€” Topography and Natural Historv. Name^ Boundaries^ ^c. â€” This parish had, in ancient times, the two names of Kilmhorie and Craignish, which were indiscrimi^ nately applied. The principal burial ground,' in the centre of which stand the ruins of a Popish chapel, is still called Kilmhorie. Kilmhorie signifies a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The other, which, in modern times, has become its sole name, is pro- nounced by Pinkerton to be Danish. In this, however, he is mis- taken, for Craignish is plainly a compound Gaelic word, and, like most Celtic names of places, it is descriptive. It denotes a rocky peninsula ; and, when one views the appearance of the parish from the west, the appropriateness of the appellation will be at once admitted. The parish lies on the western shore of Argyleshire. It is about 26 miles south-west of Inverary, 24 south of the village of Oban, and 15 north-north<-west of Lochgilphead. Its length is 11 miles and half a furlong, and its average breadth about 2 miles. On the north, it is bounded by the parish of Mel fort ; on the east, by the parishes of Dalavich and Kilmartin, and by Loch Craig- nish. On the south and west, it is washed by the Atlantic Its figure approaches that of a scalene triangle, â€” the base ex- tending nearly due east and west, and the vertex being southÂ«west. The southern half of the parish is peninsular. Topographical Appearances. â€” Its surface is much diversified. That part which lies farthest north rises to the elevation of about 700 feet above the level of the sea. It is rugged, and, for the most part, covered with heath. Along the base of this range of hills, a flat tract, of somewhat less than a quarter of a mile broad, stretches from the shore, on the west, to a river which flows on the east, between Craignish and the parish of Kilmartin. Turn- ing towards the south-west, on reaching a chain of hills on the left Digitized by Google 46 AROYLESHIRE. of this river, and extendincr for about two miles along its course to the head of Loch Craignish, it forms the valley of Barbreck. From the appearance of the rising ground on either side, it is ex- tremely probable, that, at some remote period, this flat was co- vered by the sea. The peninsular part of the parish, extending for about six miles from the head of Loch Craignish to the south-west, swells on the eastern side into numerous verdant eminences, the highest of which do not exceed, if they even reach, 300 feet. Close along the shore, a narrow strip of level land, jutting into points and winding into bays, lies between the base of these eminences and the loch. A range of heath-clad hills, of from 400 to 500 feet in height, stretch from the flat, already described as on the north of the pa* rish, longitudinally along the middle and western side, and dimi- nish gradually in elevation as they approach the sea on the south. The higher points of this range command extensive and diversified prospects. While the whole parish and Loch Craignish, with its numerous islets, are stretched close beneath, the mountains of Mull and Morven and the lofty summits of Ben Cruachan are seen to the north ; and to the south and west appear Loch Crinan, the hills of Knapdale, the sound of Jura, the island of that name, with its far-famed peaks, *' And Scarba*s isle, whose tortured shore Stdll riiiffs to Corrievrecken*s roar. And lonely Colonsay : â€” Scenes sung by him who sings no more ! His bright and brief career is o'er â€” â€¢ Â« Â« â€¢ â€¢ A distant and a deadly shore Has Leyden's cold remains." On a summer's evening, when the Atlantic, which is here stud- ded with islands, like the Aegean, reflects the glories of the set- ting sun, and the azure hues of the distant hills to the east, are seen to blend with and lose themselves in the roseate light that crowns their summits, â€” the prospect is one of surpassing beauty and magnificence. Coast, Islands, 8fc. â€” The coast, from its numerous indentations, cannot be less than sixteen miles in extent. On the east the shore, in general, is flat and clayey, with an admixture of sand. In some parts it is extremely muddy. It is rocky on the south- east, and remarkably so on the south and west. On the westiBrn side, there are several little bays, the shores of which are covered with a fine light-coloured sand. I Digitized by Google CRAIGNISH. 47 No fewer than twenty islets belong to the parish. Of these the largest on the east are islets M'Niven and M^Larty. A chain of five islets stretches to the south-west, off the southern extre- mity of the peninsula* The largest of these is called Garbhreisa, and forms, along with the extremity just mentioned, the well known passage named Dorus mor, or Great Door. About a mile and a quarter to the west of Craignish, between the mainland and Jura, lie three small islands, called Reisa-mhicfaidean, Cor-reisa, and Reisa-an-tsruth. These are nearly south of each other. The two first are separated by a very narrow channel ; the middle and most southern are much farther apart. All the islets which belong to the parish are covered with verdure, and some of them are of considerable value. The climate is extremely mild. Intense cold is rarely expe- rienced. There is little frost, and snow seldom lies more than two days upon the ground. As the parish is situated on the skirts of the Atlantic, the climate is, however, very humid. Hydrography^ Friths^ Sfc. â€” Loch Craignish, which divides the peninsular part of the parish from Kilmartin, extends into the country in a north-easterly direction. It is about six miles long. Its breadth varies. At its mouth it approaches three miles ; and at a little distance from its head, it is scarcely one. Its average depth is 12, and where deepest 16 fathoms. It is adorned with a number of beautiftil green islets, a few of which are decorated with trees of fir, ash, oak, and birch. They^ie in the form of two nearly parallel lines on either side of it. A narrow frith separates them from the mainland, and the sound or. channel which extends betwixt either parallel line is about half a mile in breadth, and of the average depth already specified. On the west of the parish, about a mile from the south point of the peninsula, is a creek called little Loch Craignish. Tides. â€” The tides to the south and west merit attention, on ac- count of their rapidity and danger. The native boatmen are so intimately acquainted with them as rarely to incur hazard ; but on several occasions, lamentable accidents have occurred in conse- quence of the inexperience or temerity of mariners from a distance. The tide of flood proceeds in a northerly direction. It sets in from the sound of Jura, and divides itself into two great currents. Of these, the one proceeds between the coast of North Knapdale and the islets which lie to the south of the Point of Craignish ; and, while a part of it flows into Loch Craignish, and Loch Cri- Digitized by Google 46 ABGYLESHIRE. nan, the larger portion runs through the Dorus ro6r, spreads as it advances, swells the waters of Little Loch Craignish and Loch Mel- fort, and ultimately loses itself on either side of the fertile island of Luing. The other flows between Jura and Reisa-an-tsruth, and rolls its waters, between the northern extremity of Jura and Scarba, into the Gulf of Coirebhrecan. The latter current is fully three- quarters of an hour later than the former. During spring-tides the current in the Dorus m6r runs at the rate of from four to flye miles an hour. Its rapidity, however, is considerably affected by winds. When the tide is rising, several dangerous whirlpools are formed ofl* the east point of the southern extremity of the parish ; and when it ebbs, whirlpools of equal danger appear on the north side of the islet which lies on tlie south of this strait* The danger of the navigation along this current is materially aug- mented when a strong breeze of wind opposes its progress. A short cross sea then rises, in which an open boat can scarcely live. Small boats and steam-vessels, which now frequently ply through this strait, generally avail themselves of the eddy tide, on the north side of the current, and thus effect a safe and expeditious passage, even when it rages with greatest violence. It is high water at the Dorus m6r at full and change at a quarter before six o'clock a. m. The flux and reflux of the tide begin here an hour before there is any sensible change on the waters of Loch Craignish. The tides in Loch Crinan and Loch Craignish corre- spond. It is high water in Loch Craignish four hours and a quarter later than in Loch Gilp. A very violent sea rises about a gunshot to the west of the west* em part of the southern extremity of the parish. It is occasioned by the confluence of the ebb tide which flows between Cor-reisa and Reisa-an-tsruth, (islets whose situation is described above^) and of that which runs through the Dorus mor. It is confined to one spot, and is known to the native boatmen by the name of Muinnachoinnich. On the coast of the islets, south and west of the parish, there are several dangerous sunk rocks. One of these lies about two gunshots off the west side of Garbhreisa, the first islet to the south, and is called Skeir-na*maoiU Another, named Skeir- nodha, lies about one quarter of a mile south of Cor-reisa. Fully the same distance west of Reisa-mhic-faidean, is a rock called Diarg-skeir; and there are two rocks of peculiar danger east- north-east of that islet. Digitized by Google CRAIGNISH, 49 Springs^ Lakes^ <J*c. â€” There are numerous perenuial springs in the parish, some of which, on the east coast, gush out of the solid rock. There are no fewer than twelve lakes. These are occasioned by the numerous inequalities that diversify the surface of the pa- rish. There are many rivulets, but only one stream which merits the name of river. It divides the upper part of the parish on the east from Kilmartin. It takes its rise from a small lake at the northÂ«eastem extremity, and, receiving numberless tributary streamlets, it flows, with a gradual declivity, and somewhat tor* tuous course, to the head of Loch Craignisb. It is called Amhain mhor, or the large river, to denote its relative magnitude, fur in reality it is of inconsiderable size. Geology.-^T\iQ geological structure of the peninsular part of the parish is schistose, the predominant rock being clay-slate, in many parts sandy, and merging in some places into a very hard eompact bastard sandstone. The direction of the strata is about south-west, or nearly the same as that of the peninsula, â€” occksion- ally, however, more to the eastward. The dip is towards the south-east. The slaty strata are in many places shifted by two sets of trap rocks. The first of these sets, consisting of a sort of claystone porphyry, of which the matrix is sandy, with crystals of felspar and black mica; and, secondly, of common whin or greenstone, which is found at the highest parts of the hills, in the middle of the pe- Binsula, and occasionally elsewhere, appearing between parallel strata of slate, and increasing the angle of dip of the superincum- bent strata. The second set of trap rocks is interesting, being most distinct specimens of basalt and whin dikes. These are at right angles to the slaty strata, traversing not only the peninsula in all its breadth, but the opposite islets in Loch Craignisb, and appearing on its eastern shore. These dikes are so unbroken, distinct, and elevated, by the decay of the softer rock, as to form the boundaries of adjacent farms ; and, on the western side, where the slaty rocks are exposed to the ravages of the weather and a tempestuous sea, huge isolated walls of greenstone and baÂ« salt, of the height of 100 feet, are seen standing erect amid the ruins of the softer rocks, and extending from the cliffs across the narrow intervening strip of flat to the sea. The islets belonging to the parish are of a schistose structure. There is limestone, in Reisa-an-tsruth. Limestone also occurs iu ARGYLB.

Tracts of sandy soil are to be met with in many parts. The soil of the paÂ« rishy as a whole, may be said to be shallow ; but it is, notwith* standing, fertile. Zoology. â€” There is no rare species of animals in the parish. Those that are found in it are common to it with the rest of ArÂ« gyleshire. In the latter end of autumn, the widgeon, several va- rieties of teal, the fieldfare, and woodcock, arrive from the Bal- tic, and remain till the month of April. lu winters of excessive severity, a migratory bird, called the velvet duck, has occasionally been seen along the shore. Wild geese are frequently observed in Little Loch Cr^ignish. Swans ajso visit the parish, though rarely. Fishes. â€” Trouts abound in the lakes and rivulets. On one lake, char is to be met with ; salmon and grilses are sometimes taken at the head of Loch Craignish. In the early part of sumÂ« mer, herrings are caught with a rod and white fly in the sea to the west. This mode of fishing them was discovered about twenty- five years ago. The herrings which are thus takea are regarded by some of the natives as a variety of this aquatic tribe. Though similar, in external appearance, to the common herrings, they maintain that their air-bladder is larger, and that others of their intestines are different. During the autumn, the common her* rings are occasionally taken, in the usual way, in Loch Craignish* There are about twenty boats belonging to the parish employed in fishing them ; and, on an average of seven years, the revenue derived from this source may be stated as L.150 per annum. Gurnet is got in considerable quantities in the sea to the west in summer, and the natives have recently beeoaie fond of this fish. Oil is extracted from its head and intestines. Seathe, of various sizes, is the most common fish, and is especially prized on account of the quantity of oil which it yields. Cod^ lythey and remarkably large mackerel are also taken, both in Loch Craignish and along the western coast and islands. Shell'Juh. â€” Lobsters and crabs are found on the southern and western shores. Oysters of laif;e size abound along the shores of the islets in Loch Craignish. The shell-fish, which, in an eco- Bomical point of view, are of most importance, are, muas9l% Digitized by Google CRAIGNISH. 51 cockles, and spout-fish. The two former are found in great abun- dance at the head of Loch Craigntsh, and the latter in a bay on the western coast. These are of considerable service to the poorer inhabitants 'in spring and summer. II. â€” Civil History. The parish belonged for some centuries to two families of the name of Campbell. The one to which the larger portion of it belonged, was the family of the Campbells of Craignish. The other family was that of the Campbells of Barbreck. Of the latter, Captain Donald Campbell, who travelled overland to India, and published an account of his travels, was a lineal descendant. In Wodrow's history of the sufferings of the Church of Scotland, from the Restoration to the Revolution, it is stated that a gentleman of this family joined the Earl of Argyle in 1685, was appointed a Colonel in his forces, accompanied him 10 his expedition to the low country, and after his leader's death underwent a public trial. In a catalogue contained in the same work, of the Scottish noblemen and gentlemen^ on whom 6nes were imposed after the Restoration, ostensibly on account of their submission to the late government, but in reality on account of thir suspected attachment to Presbyterianism, the names of Alex- ander Campbell, Captain of Craignish, and Donald Campbell of Barbreck, occur. The former was fined in L.4000 Scots, and the latter in L.266, 13s. 4d. Scots.* I'radition relates that a severe engagement took place, in an- cient times, between the Danes under Olave or Olaus, the son of their monarch, and the natives headed by their king, in the valley of Barbreck. The battle began, it is said, on a spot called Drim- ree* In the first encounter the natives were obliged to give way * Sinee Uie above was written, a printed ** account of the Campbells of Barbreck from their firstancestor to thepresent time,** has been kindly forwarded to the writer by Fnderiok William Campbell, Esq. the present representative of the iamily, andtheon- ly surriTiog son of Captain D. Campbell, the Indian traveller. This account traces tbe origin of the fiimily to the fourteenth century, and to the house of Argyle. It ap- ptan from it that the result of the public trial, undergone by Colonel Campbell, who joined Argyle in 1665, was, that the lands and Barony of Barbreck were gifted to Sir James Stewart, Sheriff of Bute, afterwards created Earl of Bute. They were, however, never taken poesessioQ of by Sir James. It also appears from it> diat tbe embarrassments occasioned by the fine suted above, were ulumately the cause of tbe tenity disposing of the estate of Barbreck, nnd fixing their residence OD lands p^r- chased in Kintyre. A curious relic, consisting of a tablet of ivory, was long preserved in this faniiTy. It was calkd '* Barbrcck*s bone,'* and was esteemed a sovereign cure for madness. When borrowed, a deposit of L.lOO was exacted to insure its safe return.

Opportunely receiving a reinforce^^ menty they rallied at a place named Sluggan, and renewed the ac- tion with such vigour that the foreigners were in their turn com- pelled to give ground. Ulric, a Danish general, was slain hereÂ» and a grey stone still marks the spot where he fell. The Danes, having in some measure recovered themselves, made an unsuccess- ful stand where they 6rst joined battle. Olave and the Scottish king are here said to have fought in single combat The formef was slain, and his remains were interred in a tumulus, since called Dunan Aula, about a quarter of a mile from Drimree, where he fell. At Drimree, a number of rude monuments were erected in honour of the warriors to whom the engagement had proved fatnl Of these some still remain. One large grey stone, together with others of smaller dimensions which stood in a circular form, were removed in order to furnish a proper site for the modern house of Barbreck. Another engagement between the Danes and the natives is said to have taken place on the western shore of the parish. Two cairns still mark its scene, and its severity may be argued from the name which it bears. It is called Dail-nan-Ceann, that is the field of heads* During the civil wars in the reign of Charles L, Alexander McDonald, (son of Colonel McDonald, commonly styled Col- quitto,) who led 1500 Irish to the assistance of Montrose, and ac- companied him, in the winter of 1644, into Argyleshire, â€” is said to have entered Craignish for the purpose of laying it waste, put- ting its inhabitants to the sword, and driving away its cattle* Campbell, the chieftain, informed of his approach, took every ne- cessary precatition to defeat his object. All the cattle in the pa- rish he caused to be removed to the islets which lie between the mainland and Jura, and swelled the garrison of his castle by re- ceiving into it all of his clan who were 6t for arms. M'Donald, on hiM arrival, immediately began a siege ; but, after spending six weeks in vain attempts to take it, found it necessary to abandon his purpose. When on the point of retiring, a sortie was made from the castle, a number of his men slain, and he himself, toge- ther with the remains of his party, compelled to quit the parish with precipitation. About half a mile to the north-west of the southern point of the peninsula, there is a small bay called the Port of the Atholmen. This appellation it received from the circumstance of seTeral of Digitized by Google CRAIQNISH. 63 the Marquis of Athole's men having been defeated by the natives and drowned in the bay, while endeavouring to escape. This nobleman, having been employed in 1685 to suppress Argyle's in- surrection, ravaged a great part of Argyleshire, and treated with barbarous severity all the families of distinction who adhered to the interests of the unfortunate Earl, and more especially those who bore the name of Campbell. Craignish, whose principal proprietors were of that name, suffered severely from the inflic- tions of his followers, and the inhabitants still relate anecdotes, handed down by tradition, of their cruelties. Land-otDners.-^Of these the chief are, Captain Donald Camp- bell, RN. of Barbreck; John M^Dougall, Esq. of Lunga; and Colin Campbell, Esq. of Jura. Parochial Registers. â€” These consist of the kirk-session record, and the register of births, baptisms, and marriages. The earliest date of the kirk-session record is the 5th Febniary 1745; and that of the first entry in the register of births, baptisms, and mar- riages, is the 7th June 1756. The latter was not regularly kept Until 1791. From that period to the present it has been cor- rectly kept. Antiquities. â€” Several rude monuments, erected to commemo- rate persons of distinction, are observable in many parts of the pa- rish. Of these, the principal are the grey stones, already noticed, as standing in the valley of Barbreck. Graves of about three and a-half feet long, composed of flags nicely adjusted, and covered with a massive stone, have often been met with, and upon being opened have been found to contain rude terra ciftta vases, in which the ashes of the dead were deposited. The ruins of two religious houses can still be traced. Of one of these, indeed, few vestiges remain. It stood near the shore a little to the north-east of the present church, and from its being still called by the natives a house of prayer, it seems to have been a Popish oratory. On a sloping field a little to the west of it, a Popish priest was interred, llie other religious house appears to have been the parish chapel. Its walls are still stand- ing. It is situated on the eastern side of the parish, and about a mile and a half from its southern extremity. Around it lies the principal burying ground. The vestiges of eleven Danish forts are also to be traced. They are, in general, small, biiilt on circular eminences, and adapted to the form of their site. Their dimensions, as stated in the former Digitized by Google ' 5\ ARGYLESHIEE. Statistical Account, were 27 feet in diametery and, as nearly as can be conjectured, from the stones which lie scattered aroiiod them, 12 feet in heighL The thickness of their walls was 7 feet. A stronghold, of greater magnitude and more importance, stood near the north-western boundary of the parish* It was built on a rocky elevation near the shore, the side next the sea being preci- pitous. Its walls are tolerably entire, and are 10 feet thick, are erected nearly in the form of an oblong square, and enclose a space of 260 by 90 feet. The part of the wall still standing is, in height, where highest, 6 feet. Within, was a well of 9 by 6 feet wide. Having been filled with rubbish, its depth cannot be ascertained. Modem Buildinfft. â€” The house of Barbreck, the seat of Captain Campbell, R. N., the principal proprietor, stands oa the north-eastern part of the parish. It is a lai^e and commo- dious building. Oii the west coast is the house of Dail, the residence of John M^Dougall, Esq. of Lunga. In the south* ern part of the parish stands Castle Craignish, the mansion of Colin Campbell, Esq. of Jura. The lower story of this building is very ancient, the upper part modern. It is a square tower, ter* minating above in embrasures. The ancient portion of the wall is 9 feet in thickness. Within, on the ground story, is a vaulted apartment, extending the whole length and breadth of the tower, which is said to have been used as a dungeon. In the centre of this apartment, an excavation, of 12 feet deep, by 8 in width, was made in the solid rock on which the castle stands. The ancient oaken door, with a frame-work of iron, still remains. The ram- part, which was erected on the eastern side of the green bank oo which the castle is situated, has been removed. The moat was 12 feet broad, and of corresponding depth. A modern house, little in unison with the appearance of the tower to which it was attach- ed, was many years ago built at the north end of the latter. Its present proprietor has removed this building, and erected an edifice in better taste, as well as more spacious. 1 1 1. â€” Population. The amount of the population at the census of 1801. was 904 1811, 826 1821, 901 1881, 892 1841, 879 The numbers of fiimilies of independent fortune residing in the parish, 4 proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and up< wards, ..... b unmarried men, upwards of 50 years of age, .

With safety it may be averred, that a fifth part of the parish might, with a profitable application of capital, be reclaimed and cultivated. The best land is, in many places, allowed to lie waste. Consisting of flat tracts at the base of the rising grounds, it is at once enriched and injured by the streamlets which flow down from the adjacent eminences, depositing additional soil, and, finding no outlet, con* verting it into swamps and quagmires. While the draining of these valuable tracts is almost wholly neglected, the major part of the farmers, from indolence or want of due encouragement, or both, till in monotonous rotation the dry sunny slopes which have been cultivated for centuries. There are not above 300 acres under wood in the whole parish, and that number is the aggregate of scattered clumps of plantation. These are chiefly to be seen in the vicinity of gentlemen's seats. The system of agriculture which prevails among the, smaller farmers, who hold the largest proportion of the parish, is still, with, in some instances, slight improvements, what was described about forty years ago in the former Statistical Account, as '^ the old system," and this fact assuredly exhibits no favourable view of it. In a few farms a better system is pursued. Those which are in the possession of the proprietors are subdivided and enclos- ed; draining has been carried on upon them to a considerable Digitized by Google 56 ARQYLESUIRE. extent; and husbandry is practised according to the most approved rules. There are only three farmers in the parish who enjoy leases; and this fact, coupled with want of capital on the part of the great mass of the tenantry, will go far to account for the neglected state of considerable tracts susceptible of high tm^ provemeot. In about half-a-dozen farms, the buildings are commodious and substantial ; in the remainder very inferior. The farming implements are good. Iron ploughs were intro- duced some years ago, and are now in pretty general use; A cart costs about L.6 ; an iron plough, L.4, lOs. ; a wooden plough, L.2. There are two corn-mills and one thrashing-mill in the parish. The former are moved by water ; the latter is wrought by horses. The common breed of cattle is the West Highland. A few low country cows are kept for milk by the upper classes. Black- faced sheep are those most generally kept. There are also a few Leicester and Cheviot sheep. Much attention is paid to the breed of horses, and those now used are larger and more powerful than those employed about thirty years ago. Improvements. â€” The principal recent improvements have been effected on the farms of Barbreck, Dail, Castle Craignish, Ard- larach, and Kilbride. These consist chiefly of draining, subdi- viding, enclosing, and planting. Improvements of this description are now going on to a great extent on the farms of Castle Craig* nish and Aird. Produce. â€” The average gross amount and value of raw produce raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, are, Oats, imperial bushel, 11,750 at Ss. 9<]. per husbd, L.I6I5 12 Bear, do. 2203 at 3s. 6d. do. Flax, 513 lbs. at Is per lb. Potatoes, 2784 bolls at 88. per boll, - Turnips, 13 acres at L.6 per acre. Cultivated hay, 10,000 stones at lOd. per stone, Meadow hay, 1 1,610 stones at 7d. per stone. Fisheries, - - . . Peats, -kjOO carts at is. per cart, Sales of live-stock, ... Dairy produce, â€¢ â€¢ * Miscellaneous, - - . Total yearly value of raw produce. The yearly grazing of a cow or full-grown ox is L.2 ; and of a sheep or ewe, 3s. The valued rent of the parish in Scots money is L.2197, ITs^ el, L.I6I5 12 r> 385 10 6 25 12 1113 12 78 416 13 4 338 12 6 200 240 2270 700 74 - L.7457 12 10 Digitized by Google CRAIGNISH. 5t â€¢The real rent, exclusive of kain and servitudes, which are in some instauees still exacted, is, in Sterling money, L.2646, 10s. Manufactwres. â€” Kelp was, until lately, manufactured in the parish. The free importation of barilla has, however, superseded this commodity, and entailed a severe loss on the Highlands. The annual average loss sustained by the proprietors of this [;parish is .L.220. The natives in general experienced little or none, as the hands employed in its manufacture were chiefly strangers from the adjacent islands. Navigation. â€” One small vessel only belongs to the parish, and is chiefly employed in ferrying cattle from Jura to the mainland, on their way to the markets of Dumbarton, Doune, and Falkirk. The average number ferried annually, (including with^ those of Jura, some from Islay and Colonsay,) may be stated at 3000 sheep, and 1000 heads of black cattle. Vessels from Glasgow and Greenock occasionally trade to Loch Craignish, bringing cargoes of c^als and carrying off pota- toes. In the spring, vessels from Ireland sometimes arrive for supplies of seed potatoes* V. â€” Parochial Economy. There is no market-town, nor is there any considerable village in the parish. Markets are frequently held in some villages in ihe neighbourhood, and particularly at Lochgilphead, â€” a place of some importance, where the natives dispose of their raw produce, and procure the few luxuries in which they have it in their power to indulge. Means of Communication. â€” Lochgilphead is the post-town, and a post goes there and returns thrice a week. The road be- tween Lochgilphead and Oban passes for two miles through th e parish. From this the parish road branches off to the south>west, and proceeds, for the most part, along the eastern shore to the harbour of Little Loch Craignish. Bridges have beep erected where necessary. The Crinao Canal affords the means of easy and frequent com* oiunication with the low country. Steam-boats plying through it between Glasgow and Inverness pass the southern extremity of the parish every alternate day, and often land goods and pasÂ« sengers. Harbours. â€” There is a safe harbour in Little Loch Craignish, whither vessels frequently repair, either for shelter in tempestuous weather, or for the purpose of awaiting a favourable state of the tide Digitized by Google 58 AEGTLESHIRE. at the Dorus Mor. The north end of Large Loch Craigmdi toma a commodious harbour. The entraoce into it is free from sunk rocks, the anchorage is good, and, being almost surrounded with hills, its waters rarely experience any violent agitation. Ecckriaitical State, â€” The first Presbyterian church was erected in this parish in the year 169a Presbyteriaaism was, howerer, established some time before, though the date of its first introduc- tion cannot be ascertained. The first resident Presbytman cler- gyman appears to have been the Rev. John Darroch, who was transported to Craignish from the united parishes of Kilcahnonell and Kilberry, and the chapel of Skipness, on the 8th day of June 169*2, and departed this life on the 6th May 1780. He was sue- ceeded by the Rev. Archibald Smith, who was ordained and ad- mitted on the 2dd day of April 1785, and died while attending the meeting of the General Assembly of 1787. The next miÂ« nister of Craignish was the Rev. Hugh Campbell, who was or- dained and admitted on the 26th of September 17d8Â» and was loosed from his charge to be transported to the parish of Rothe* say, on the 1 6th of October 1754. The Rev. Lachlan Campbell, translated from the parish of Af dnamurchan, was admitted minis- ter of Craignish on the 22d of July 1755, and died on the 8th of December 1768. The Rev. Paul Eraser, D. IX, waa admitted minister of this pa- rish on the 17th April 1765, and was loosed from bis charge and translated to Inverary on the 17th of June 1789. He was suc- ceeded by the Rev. Lachlan Maclachlan, who was ordained and admitted minister of Craignish on the 23d September 1789, and died in summer 1795. The Rev. Francis Stewart was translated from the parish of Kilchrenan and Dalavich, and admitted minis* ter of Craignish on the 24 th September 1795, and died on the 13th day of February 1832. The present minister was ordained and admitted as assistaDt and successor to the last incumbent on the 1st of September 1831. The present church stands on a little green on the eastern side of the parish. It was erected in 1826. It is neat, commodious, and conveniently situated. There is only one family more than four miles distant from it. It is capable of containing 500 sitters, and is, in general, well attended. The average number of com- municants is 180. There are two Dissenters in the parish. Benefactions. â€” The sum of L. 50 was bequeathed in trust to Digitized by Google CRAIGNISH^ 58 the Qiioister and elders for pious purposes in 1751, by John Camp* bell, Esq., youngest son of George Campbell, Esq. of Craignisb. The late Major- General John Campbell of Barbreck left in 1795, the sum of L. 60, the interest of which is annually distributed by the fcirk-sessioo among the poor on that estate. In 1835, a sum of upwards of L. 60 was invested by Colin Campbell, Esq. Jura, in a share of the Edinburgh Old Gas Light Company, the pro- ceeds of which are to be distributed among the paupers on the Castle Craignisb estate, and should there be none on that property, among the poor of the parish at large. A right to send a patient to the Glasgow Infirmary has also been generously conferred by same gentleman on the kirk-session. Stipend. â€” The stipend is 1 18 bolls 3 firlots of oatmeal^ and LtalO, 7s. ds. in money, together with Lt48y 6s. 6d. allowed by Government out of the bishops' rents. The manse stands on a rising-ground a little to the west of the church, and is nearly surrounded with trees. Together with offices and garden wall, it was built in 1834, and is a comfortable and commodious building. The glebe is about 15 acres in extent. Having been much improved by the last incumbent, it may be valued at L.17 per dnnum. Education. â€” There is one parochial schooL It is situated near the church. In the north end of the parish there is a small school taught on the teacher's own adventure. The branches commonly taught in both, are English and Gaelic reading, writing, arith- metic, and book-keeping. Latin is occasionally taught in the parochial school. The parochial teacher enjoys the legal accom- modations. His salary is the minimun), and the average joint amount of his salary and school fees is L.53. The amount of fees received by the other teacher is LfolO. The number of persons above fifteen years of age who are illi- terate is now about 60. Poor and Parochial Funds. â€” The average number of persons receiving parochial aid is 15. The annual amount of church col- lections for their relief is LI2; from l^acies, fines, &c* L.12. The laudable desire of independence was till lately, happily pre- valent, and few persons sought parochial relief until compelled by imperious necessity. Inns. â€” Tl>ere are three public-houses in the parish ; but they Digitized by Google M AR6TLB8HIRB. do not appear to exert, to any material extent, a pemicioas influ- ence on the morals of the inhabitants. FueL â€” The fuel most commonly used is peats. These are dug in the l^lly parts of the parish. Their quality in the peninsula b regarded as inferior. Coals from Glasgow are now procured in summer at the rate of from 13s. to 1 5s. per waggon, and are chiefly used by the upper classes. MiSCELLANKOUS OBSERVATIONS. Most of the superstitious practices which existed among the natives have now disappeared, or, if still observed, are observed only as means of entertainment by the youthful portion of the in- habitants. One pernicious relic of Popery the late venerable clergyman of the parish was mainly instrumental in abolishing. At the time of his appointment to the beneBce, parents, actuated by a blind and superstitious desire for the salvation of their offspring, carried their new-born babes, as soon as swaddled^ to the minister to be bap- tized ; and this practice, as may be easily conjectured, was, in nu- merous instances, attended with fatal consequences. By the ex- ercise of firmness, and the assiduous employment, on his part, of every means to enlighten the people, it was, however, many years ago completely extirpated. Nor was this the only improvement effected during his ministry. By the strict exercise of discipline the morals of the inhabitants were ameliorated, and, by the force of reiterated admonitions, their eyes were opened to the benefits of education, and a desire for religious knowledge awakened in their bosoms. The facilities of communication have been greatly increased since the last Statistical Account was published. The public roads have undergone material improvement, and the opening of the Cri- nan Canal, and, more recently, the frequent intercourse by steamers between the Highlands and the towns of the low country, enable the natives to turn their raw produce to greater account, and pro- cure, at a much cheaper rate than formerly, such necessaries as the parish does not itself produce, and such articles of luxury as their circumstances will allow them to use. Much improvement might be introduced into the mode of let- ting land in the parish. Leases ought to be more generally given ; and, where there are more tenants than one in a single farm, each should be rendered independent of the other, so that a spirit of emulation might be excited, or, at least, that the ignorant and in* Digitized by Google KILNINVBR AND KILMBLPOUT. 61 dolent might not have it in his power to obstruct the course of bis. iTipre skilful and industrious neighbour. Draining and enclosing should be carried on to a much greater extent, and every encou- ragement afforded to the cultivation of green crops, to which the climate is peculiarly adapted. Plantations of wood should also be formed, as there ^re many eminences at present of little value, and assuredly of no beauty, which, if planted with oak, ash, and larch, the timber in most demand for rural purposes, might, at a mode- rate expense, be rendered at once highly productive and extremely ornamental. A few slopes there are, throughout the peninsula, in which stools of native oak are so numerous, that, if protected by enclosures from the browsing of sheep and black-cattle, they would, in a brief term of years, be adorned by thriving trees. . Revised July 1843. PARISH OF KILNINVER AND KILMELFORT.^ PRESBYTERY OF LORN, SYNOD OF ARGILS. I. â€” Topography and Natural History. Name. â€” The name Kilninver is compounded of two Gaelic words, viz. At7, a burying-place, and inbher (inver) the foot of the river or water ; which is descriptive of the situation of the anÂ« cient burying-place or chapel from which the name of the parish is derived. Kilnamaolphort, or Kilnameallard, or Kilnameallphort, contracted Kilmelfort, signifies either the burying-ground of the smooth or round bays, or, according to some, the promontory's bay, â€” there being a high and rocky point of land jutting out into the head of LochmeHbrt, forming on each side two round bays. Extent and Boundaries. â€” The united parish is about 12 square miles. It is bounded on the east,, by the parishes of Kilmore and Kilcbrenan ; on the south, by Dalavich and Craignish ; on the west, by Kilbrandon and the sound of Mull ; and on the north, by Lochfeuchan, which separates it from the parish of Kilbride, or, as it is generally called, Mid Lorn. * Towards the east and * Drawn up hj the late Rev. John Ferguson, Assistant Minister of the parish. Digitized by VjOOQlC 62 ARGYI.KSHIRE. south the ground is high^ and consists of hill and dale. Glen- cHichar, so called from a river of that name running through it, eitends for about six miles, intersecting the parish of Kilninver from east to west The strath or low ground produces good crops of corn and potatoes, and the hills, in rainy seasons, yield exeellent pasture. The Braes of Lorn, another glen or slnth running pa- rallel with Gleneuchar on the south, ia inferior to it in point of extent aud tillage, but far superior on account of the richness of the pasture, and the abuncbmce of limestone and peat which it affords* In the west end of the parish, called Nether Lorn, there are about three miles of arable land, consisting of clayey soil and black loam on sand or slate. It is highly cultivated, and produces excellent crops of com, barley, bear, potatoes, turnips, clover, and rye grass. Except rich pasture and fine perennial springs, there is nothing very remarkable, connected with the hills in the parish. The highest is Ben-chapull or ^* mares' mountain," towering above all the neighbouring hills, and commanding a very extensive and de- lightftil view to the west and north. It is about 1500 feet above the level of the sea. The other hills extend in four different ranges, and terminate on the sea coast On the south side of Gleneuchar, there appears to have been a volcanic eruption or the shock of an earthquake, whose effects present a grotesque and awful appearance. Topographical Appearances, â€” The united parish has about fourteen miles of sea coast, with a number of bays and iih- lets, which afford a safe and convenient anchorage. From the estuary of the river Euchar to the sound of Claehanseil, a dis- tance of five miles, there are two promontories, higk and rocky, forming an extensive and beautiful bay, having a clayey bottom and a smooth and sandy shore. From thence to the sound of Clachan, the .coast is very nigged and dangerous to ship-* ping. The rocks are composed of sandstone and slate, with veins of whbstooe interspersed* The sound above-mentioned, which forms the western boundary of Kilninver, is about two miles long, and averages about eighty feet broad. It runs smooth ainl' straight, with a strong current, and forms a beautiful canal. Though it is passable at some places at low water, and a regular ferry al-* ways available, yet the inconvenience was generally felt and com* plained of. A bridge at length was built, consisting of a single Digitized by Google KILNINVER AND KIKMRLFORT. 63 arch, 72 feet wide and 27 feet above the highest water-mark, and admits vessels of about twenty tons burden. At both ends of the Sound, which is north and south, there is good and safe anchorage. â€¢Viewing the whole from the sea, it exhibits a most delightful and picturesque scenery. Ix)chmelfort gives a sea coast of upwards of six miles, indented with large and beautiful bays. The hill ranges on both sides are higher than the coast of Lochfeuchan; but the shore, for the most part, is sandy, and well adapted to Bshing stations. There is a cave on the north shore, which tradition says aflforded shelter to the first settlers, until they procured more comfortable accommodation. It is so remote, and so thickly surrounded with woods, that detection is scarcely possible. Some years ago, smug- glers made it their head-quarters ; and one of them, at least, made a large fortune by illicit distillation, and was never discovered. Climate^ ^c â€” The temperature of the atmosphere is remarka- bly mild, but the weather is exceedingly changeable. The pre* vailing winds are the south, south-west, and west During the months of July, August, and September, the wea* ther is generally rainy, which, though highly favourable to the grazier in the upper parts of the parish, yet proves prejudicial to the interests of the agriculturist, whose loss is greater in propor- tion to his industry in raising early and heavy crops. During this period, and generally throughout the year, when rain is near, the mountains of Jura, Scarba, and Mull in the distance, give timeous warning of its approach^ by enveloping their summits in mist ; and whatever indications of fair weaiher the general aspect of the 4^y may present, those more immediately concerned sel- dom mistake the prognostications of these splendid and time-set barometers. In March and October, easterly winds prevail for some weeks. The weather is dry, but unhealthy, and is not less injurious to vegetation than it is unpleasant to the human frame. Moist as the climate is, and variable as the weather generally is, to the natives at least it is salubrious } and the most convincing proof of this is their longevity. There are at present, living in the parish, five individuals, whose united ages amount to 453 years. The only distempers which can be attributed to the influence of climate are, colds, asthma, and rheumatism, which are rather prevalent among old people. It is observed that they are less hardy, and more subject to diseases, since the Highlaud dress was laid aside*. Digitized by Google 64 ARGYLESIliUK. Hydrography. â€” Lochfeuchan, aa already observed, bounds the parish for about three miles. The average breadth is about a mile, and the depth fifteen falhoms. During the flowing and ebbing of spring*tides, it has the appearance of a large and rapid river. â€¢ Lochnielfort is nearly four miles long, two broad, and thirty-five fathoms deep, though both are arms of the great Atlantic Ocean, and consequently largely partaking of its quality. Yet, the im* mense quantity of fresh water, which constantly flows into them, materially affects their saltness, colour, and temperature. There are numerous perennial springs in the valleys along the hills, and on the shore ; some of them gush from rocks, others are filtrated through banks of sand, and a few mineral springs ooze through moss. The most of them seem to flow from inexhaustible reservoirs in the bowels of the hills. In this country, where rain is so frequent, and lakes and rivers so numerous, springs, in ge- neral, are little noticed or valued ; but, in dry seasons, or during severe winters, their advantage is particularly felt. On such oc- casions, when other sources fail, or are inaccessible, these continue their supply, and, in the depth of winter, preserve the verdure of the encircled herbage as well as their refreshing quality. There are about twenty lakes in the parish, the largest of which is Lochscaroadale, about two miles long from east to west, half a mile broad, and twenty fathoms deep. Being surrounded on all sides with hills of considerable height, except towards the west, it is abundantly supplied with innumerable streams, springs, and mountain torrents. During floods, the noise of these pouring over precipitous rocks, arid foaming through deep and narrow ravines, is truly tremendous. The scenery, upon the whole, is beautiful. Lochbrallaig, in the Braes of Lorn, is upwards of a mile long and half a mile broad. It extends in a parallel line with Loch- scamadale ; a range of hills of 800 feet extend along the north side, which form a very grand scenery. At the base of a rock many hundred feet high, and within a few yards from the lake, stands a schooUhouse, where the children of the district are taught. ' Line, or String Lake, at the eastern extremity of the pa- rish, is about a mile in circumference. The trout in this lake are superior to any in this country, in point of size and quali^. Lochseil, about a mile east of the Sound of Seil, and only a few feet above its level, is nearly two miles in circumference, and its average depth is ten fathoms. From its proximity tQ the sea,- Digitized by Google KILNINVER AND KILMÂ£LFORT. 65 and the low and marly nature of the intervening ground, it appears to have been at one time an arm of the sea. The Parson's Lake, about a mile from the bead of Locbmel- fert, is upwards of a mile in circumference, and is remarkable for its beauttftti wooded island and ruins. The scenery on the north side is extremely wild. Rhen.^The river Euchar has its source in Lochscamadale, running westward for about two miles, and then takes a northerly direction for about the same distance, and falls into the sea at Kit ninver. Prom the extent and depth of its source, and the number of tributary streams which swell it in its course, it is among the lar- gest in this part of the country. Its banks are 6nely wooded, and about a mile irom the sea the scenery is very grand and beautiful. At this place it flows through a deep ravine of solid rock. A waterfall of several feet high has formed a very deep pool, which is a rendezvous for all the heavy salmon which fail to overcome that physical barrier in their course to the lake. Before the law respecting fisheries was revised and rigorously enforced, there were often caught in this pool from 60 to 100 large salmon. On the south bank, and immediately above that romantic spot, once stood the mansion of the ancient and brave M'Dougalls of Raray. The river Oude flows from Lochtrallaig, and is nearly five miles in length from north-east to south-west. It runs for about two miles through the braes of Lorn, in the parish of Kilninver, and joins the sea at an extensive and beautiful bay on the north side of the head of Locbmelfort About a mile from its junction with the sea, it runs through a district presenting scenery of the grandest de- scription. What renders this spot so interesting is, that the great public road from Lochgilphead to Oban passes through it. The rocks on both sides are several hundred feet high, and in many places overhanging the road. The Kirkton water issues from the parson's lake, running upwards of a mile south-west, and falls into the south bay at the end of Locbmelfort A few yards from its source, it forms a very fine cascade, forty feet high. The range of hills, as already observed, which bound the united parish on the east and south-east, abounds with limestone which, in consequence of the facility of procuring peat from the interven- ing valleys, is likely, at no distant period, to be turned to a good ABGTLE. Â£ Digitized by Google ^ ARGYLESIIIBE. account, by improving the pasture on the heathy moors, and sup- plying the agriculture in the district. Along the banks of the rivers, especially where they join the sea, there is a quantity of alluvial deposit, over clay or sand* The afv* pearance of the banks of the Eachar at Kilninver, and the forma- tion of the rocks, show clearly that the whole of that strath was un- der the water. Freestone, of a light blue colour, and of excel- lent quality, abounds on the coast. Its distance from mai^et, however, prevents it from being wrought, otherwise it might yield a great revenue to the proprietor, and employment to the poor. Zoology. â€” The number of horses and cattle in the parish may be computed as follows: horses, 150; black-cattle, 1200; sheep, 15,000. Since the old forests have been cut down, many of the wild animals which once lived here have disappeared. Red*deer are seldom seen, and when they do visit us from the neighbouring forests of Glenurchy, they only continue a few days. There are still roes, hares, foxes, martins, badgers, polecats, wild-cats, otters, weasels. Of the feathered kind there are blackcocks, partridges, wood- cocks, moorfowls, snipes, pigeons, grey and green plovers, differ- ent species of eagles, wild-ducks, and ^ great variety of water- fowls, such as is common on the west coast Along the whole coast, there is abundance of fish of all kinds, 8uchÂ« as salmon, herring, ling-fish, mackerel, turbot, saithe, had- dock, whiting, lythe, gurnet, red-fish, sword-fish, eel, flounder, and skate, &c. There is a variety of shell-fish round the shores of Locbfeuchan and Lochmelfort, such as oysters, lobsters, crabs, mussels, spout- fish, cockles, welks, lampreys. The lakes and rivers abound with trout and perches. The time when the salmon come up the river to spawn, is from the beginning of October to the end of December. IL â€” Civil History. Traditions of battles fought in this parish during the feudal times, especially between the Campbells^ and M^Dougalls, might easily be obtained ; but though they might furnish materiak for the poet or the novellist, yet, at this distance of time, and in the absence of any written document, they cannot be depended upon as historical facts. It is said, however, that an authentic ac- count of these, and of several other important events connected with the parish, is to be found in the Duke of Argyle's library at Inverary. 3 Digitized by Google KILNINVEtt AND KILMELFORT. 67 One of these is so weH corroborated by other evidences, that it deserves to be noticed. The notorious Alexander McDonald, better known in the Highlands by the name of Alastair Mac* ChoUa, having, in his warlike expedition through Argyle, passed through this parish, the men fled at his approach, but women and children, to the number of several scores, fled into a barn, where they were discovered, and without the least offence or pro- vocation, barbarously burnt to ashes. The ruins, where this traÂ« gical deed was perpetrated, are still seen, bearing the name of the bones' barn. Eminent Men. â€” About ninety years ago, the Rev. Alexander M^Farlane, then minister of the parish, translated the Psalms, and Baxter^s Call to the Unconverted, into Gaelic, and though several improved editions have since been published, more in accordance with the dialect now spoken, still his name deserves to be grate- fully remembered for his faithfulness and zeal in supplying his countrymen with these In their vernacular language, when so few could either read or understand English.. He was latterly minister of Arrochar, Dumbartonshire. Within the last forty years, Archibald Campbell, son of the late Mr Patrick Campbell, q^inister of Kilninver, was one of the most eminent mathematicians in his day. He gave early indications of genius, and prosecuted his studies with success. He contributed to the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, and also to several periodicals of the day* His scientific acquirements may be estimated by the ability with which he wrote on Annuities and Acoustics. In the prime of life, he fell a victim to intense application to his favourite studies, and was buried at Kilninver. Admiral Sir Patrick Campbell, K. C. B., and his brother, Sir â€¢ Colin, lately Governor of Nova Scotia, now of Ceylon, are natives of this parish. They have long filled high and honourable situa- tions in the army and navy, and in their respective departments distinguished themselves in a manner worthy of the brave and patriotic family of Melfort, of which they are descended. Heritors, â€” The principal heritors are, the Marquis of Breadal- bane, the Duke of Argyle, the Lorn Furnace Company, and John Campbell, Esq. of G lenmore. Parochial Registers, â€” The earliest date of the parochial registers is 1758. If any were kept previous to that period, they are irreco- verably lost. Till within the last twenty years, there was but one register for both parishes ; but the distance between the two places Digitized by Google 6d AnGYLESHlRÂ£. r^dered such an arrangement inconvenient ; there is, therefore, one kept in each. These are under the immecUate inspection of the kirk-session, and from tiooe to time examined by the presby- tery of the bounds, and consequently are regularly kept Antiquities. â€” The few antiquities in the parish consbt of cairns, tumuli, and large stones standing perpendicular. Some are isolated, others placed in a circular position. There was a tumulus of great antiquity in the immediate neighbourhood of Kilninver, called Du* nanbuiaig, after the name of a Danish princess, named Buiag, or yellow-haired. About thirty years ago, some masons, in quest of materials for building, barbarously demolished it, and found careful- ly preserved in a stone coffin, an urn of great antiquity, which ap- peared to have contained the ashes of some illustrious personage. Cairn Challein, or Colin's cairn, is erected on a conspicuous spot, on the old line of road, between Kilninver and Lochawe, where it is said (and other historical events substantiate the fact) that M^Callein More, then knight at Lochawe, was treacherously slain, while returning victorious at the head of his men from a skir- mish against some of the neighbouring clans. Within a mile of this cairn, there is a burying place, where those who fell on the occa- sion above alluded to, are interred. A little to the south of this classic spot, Line lake, with its beautiful island and time-worn ruin, are situated. In feudal times, a banditti of freebooters made this their head- quarters, and for nearly a century infested not only the surrounding district, but made predatory incursions to the adjoin- ing counties. On a wooded island in the Parson's Lake, there stand the ruins of a castle or monastery, with twelve apartments. The most ancient of all the ruins in the |iarish, called Dun- Mhie Raonaill, or Ronaldson's tower, is situated on a point on the coast of the Sound of Mull ; when or by whom built is unknown. It appears to have been intended as a beacon or watch tower, for the purpose of giving timeous warntog of any hostile invasion. Simi- lar towers are numerous along the coast, and were so situated, that with corresponding signals, well understood by those concerned, intelligence of the approach of an enemy by sea or land might be communicated some hundred miles in a few hours. III. â€” Population. The population in 1881 was 1072. At present it does not exÂ« iseed 970, which shows a deereaae of upwards of 100 within the last ten years. Digitized by Google KILNINVER AND KILMELFORT. 69 *The yearly average of births is . 12 deaths, . . .10 marriages, . 7 The average number of persons under 15 years of age, â€¢ 325 betwixt 15 and 30, . . 184 30 and 50, . 248 50 and 70, . 164 upwards of 70, . . 46 Number of families of independent fortune residing in the parish, . 2 arietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards, 8 elor8,fcc. upwards of 50, 28 unmarried women above 45, ..... 35 insane or fatuous, . * 6 Three of these are dumb, and one deaf and dumb ; blind, . 9 The language generally spoken is Gaelic, which has lost ground considerably within the last forty years. IV. â€” Industry. There is a considerable extent of ground under wood. The indigenous trees are oak, ash, birch, elm, alder, mountain ash, and hazel. Those planted are, Scotch fir, larch, spruce, plane tree, beech, chestnut, poplar, and lime, which are properly fenced and pruned, and thrive well. The general character of the husbandry is, as nearly as circum- stances will admit, the same as in the south of Scotland. The Marquis of Breadalbane, who is proprietor of two-thirds of the pa- rish of Kilninver, gives every encouragement to his tenants to im- prove their lands. Other proprietors who farm their own estates, are not behind in improvements. Cattle shows and ploughing matches are annually held in the parish, and have a powerful influence in stimulating the tenants to industry> Leases are generally from seven to nineteen years. There are two salmon fisheries, one at the junction of the river Euchar with Lochfeuchan, and the other at the foot of the Oude. The former pays about L. 40 of rent, and the latter L. 30. The herring fishing in Lochmelfort has been very successful for several years. It is a source of great benefit, not only to the pa- rishioners, but also to the whole district. A great quantity of kelp used to be manufactured here, which employed many of the labouring classes ; but of late years it has been found a losing spe- culation, and has been consequently abandoned. There is a large distillery in the parish, where a number of people are employed. It is under such excellent management, that no bad effects on the morals of the people employed at it are visible. Digitized by Google 70 ARGYLESHIRE. V. â€” Parochial Economy. The nearest market-town is Oban, which is about eight miles distant from Kilninver. The length of the public road through the parish is about fifteen miles. Ecclesiastical State. â€” There are churches at Kilninver and Kil- melfort about eight miles distant from each other, where the mi- nister preaches alternately. The church at Kilninver was built about fifty years ago, and affords accommodation to 45Q. That at Kilmelfort is seated for 250. Both are kept in excellent repair. There is no manse in the parish. The sum of L.50 is allowed for manse money. The glebe (except about an acre at Kilninver) is at Kilmelfort, and is let for L.18. The stipend is the minimum. The Duke of Argyle is patron of Kilmelfort, and the Marquis of Breadalbane is patron of Kilninver; they present per vices. There is no chapel of ease nor Dissenting chapel in the pa- rish. There are only a few families of Dissenters in the parish. The number of communicants is about 250. The collections for the poor amount on an average to L. 12, and the average cdiec- tion for religious purposes is L. 10 per annum. Education. â€” There are 4 schools, viz. 2 parochial schools, I As- sembly school, and one supported by the tenants^ with some assist- ance by the Marquis of Breadalbane. The schoolmaster at Kil- ninver has L.34 of salary, with an allowance of L.6, 8s. in lieu of dwelling house and garden. The salary at Kilmelfort is L.25, with L.4 for house and garden. The Assembly teacher has L.25, with an additional allowance for accommodation. There is also a sewing, spinning, and knitting-school at Clachanseil, supported by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. Poor^s Fund, â€” The average number of poor is 40w The he- ritors give an annual donation, which, with church collections, forms the only fund for their maintenance. For several years past, wealthy people connected with the parish have given libe- rally, and consequently the poor have been well supplied Inde- pendently of this source, which may be considered as temporary, the most necessitous receive cibout L. 4 a-year, with a free house and garden, and some potato ground. Fair, â€” There is a fair held in May and November for the pur- pose of hiring servants. Inns^ 8cc, â€” There are two inns and two public houses or dram- shops in the parish. One inn is indispensable, the others are a nuisance. Digitized by VjOOQ IC KILBRANDON AND KILCHATTAN. 71 Fti^I.â€” -Gentlemen fanners use coals, but the people in general use peat for fuel, of which abundance is found in the hills. 184a PARISHES OF KILBRANDON AND KILCHATTAN* PRESBTTBRY OF LORN, SYNOD OF ARGYLE. I. â€” TOPOGEAPHY AND NATURAL HiSTORY. Name. â€” This parish has received its name from some one of those Scottish saints who, no doubt, were celebrated in their own times, but of whom very little is now known, except that they were companions or followers of the famous St Columba. It ap- pears that, before the Reformation, there were four churches or chapels within the bounds of the present parish, which were dedi- cated respectively to Brenan or Brandon, Cattan, Bride or Brid- get, and Coan. The places where these churches once stood^ and where the ruins of some of them are still to be seen, are called Kilbrandon, Kilchattan, Kilbride, and Kilchoau. When these four churches or parishes were united, the last two names were dropped, whilst the other two are still retained. The parish is generally called Cuan by the country people, from the circum- stance that the present church stands near the narrow sound of Cuan, (derived from the Gaelic cumharij narrow,) which separates Seil from Luing. Extent^ Boundaries^ Sfe. â€” The parish is situated in that district of Argyle called Nether Lorn. It consists of a portion of the mainland and a group of islands, five of which are inhabited, viz. Seil, Luing, Easdale, Torsay, and Shuna. Its greatest length from north to south is 10 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 6 miles from east to west. The district on the mainland belong- ing to the parish is about 4 miles long, and two miles broad ; Seil 4 by 2; Luing 6 by 2; Shuna 2^ by 1^. Each of the other islands is less than a'square diile. On the east side, the parish is bounded by Kilninver and Kilmelfort, from which it is separated on the DQrth-east by the Sound of Clachan, and on the south-east * Draim up bj the late incumbent^ the Rev. Finlaj M^Pherson. Digitized by Google 72 ARGTLESHIRE. by Lochmelfort, one of the outlets of which lies between Shuna and the parish of Craignish. On the south it is bounded by the north end of the Sound of Jura, a branch of which, from I to 2 miles in breadth, separates Luing on the south*west from Scarba and other small islands belonging to the parish of Jura. On the north-west, it is bounded by the Sound of Mull, which is here about 8 miles in breadth, thus leaving a part of the parish due west, of some miles in extent, open to the Atlantic Ocean. The islands of Soil and Luing, which constitute the principal part of the parish, form one contiguous range, with the exception of the narrow sound of Cuan for 10 miles in length. Along the east side of these islands, the land is low and indented with bays. On the west, the coast is generally high and rocky, particularly about Â£asdale, thus presenting a bold front to the waves of the Atlantic, which in stormy weather beat with great violence against these shores. There are no high mountains in the parish, but there are seve- ral ridges of hills rising in some parts to the height of 600 or 800 feet above the level of (he sea* The island of Seil consists very much of undulating low hills, with fertile slopes and valleys. Luing is generally more level. The soil in both these islands is well adapted for every species of crop, but the climate is so varia- ble and moist, that the expectations of the husbandman are often disappointed. The district on the mainland consists chiefly of hill pasture. There are no rivers in this neighbourhood, but their place is supplied to a certain extent, by the number of narrow sounds by which the parish is so much intersected. The Sounds of Insh and Easdale are on the west coast, lying between the islands of the same names and Seil. The Sound of Clachan, which separates Seil from the mainland, is only a few yards in breadth. It runs nearly in a straight line for about two miles, and might be taken for an alpine river. A bridge was built across this sound fifty years ago, being perhaps the first instance of the kind in Great Britain where an island was thus joined to the mainland. This bridge is 70 feet wide, and 26 feet above high water mark, so that small vessels of twenty tons burden may pass under it. The skiffs from the north find a safe passage through Clachan in bad wea* ther, when they could not venture with safety round the west coast. This sound is very shallow, being dry in some parts at low water. The Sound of Cuan is much broader and deeper than that of Clachan, and the current here is very strong, running at the Digitized by VjQOQ IC KILBRANDON AND KILCHATTAN. 73 rate of seven or eight miles an ho4ir. The tide here takes a very circuitous course round the north end of Torsay> which juts out from the north-east end of Luing, and from which it is separated by a sound a few feet in breadth, and might easily be shut up al- together. The Sound of Shuna lies between the island of that name and LuingÂ« Bays. â€” There are several bays and harbours in the parish where vessds of any size may safely ride at anchor, and where many of those which sail along the west coast run for shelter in 8tonny weather. The principal bays are, that of Ardmaddy on the mainland, Bulvicar in Seil, and Blackmtllbay in Luing. There is also a good harbour at Easdale, and another at Toberonochy, on the east side of Luing. Climate. â€” It is well known that the weather in winter is much milder on the west coast than in the interior of the country,<'^the frost is not so intense, and the snow does not continue long on the ground. There being no rain-guage in the neighbourhood, the quantity of rain that fells cannot be given, but there is seldom any complaint of the lack of moisture. From a note taken, some time ago, of the prevailing winds, it appears that the wind general- ly ranges from south to north-west for two-thirds of the year. The north wind generally brings dry weather along with it. Although the climate is moist, it is rather salubrious, owing to the sea air, which is here very strong and pure. There are very few diseases peculiar to the district. Those arising from exposure to cold and damp, and from a defective and unwholesome diet, are the most prevalent, such as rheumatism, consumption, dropsy, &c. As there is always a medical man employed to attend the quarries, the people have an opportunity of getting their children vaccinated, which, however, is too much neglected till small-pox breaks out amongst them. . Typhus fever and small-pox are often conveyed from the south country by those young people who go thither in quest of employment. Their friends, from motives of mistaken kindness, insist on taking them home before they have fully recovered, which brings disease amongst the people. For some years past, owing chiefly to this cause, cases of fever have been very prevalent in the parish. II. â€” Civil History. Heritors. â€” About three-fourths of the parish belong to the Marquis of Breadalbane. The other heritors are, the heirs of the late John M^Dougall, Esq. of Ardincaple ; Major Campbell of Digitized by Google 74 AR6TLE8HIRE. Melfort; and the Town- Council of Gla^w, to whom the hlani of Shuna was left by the late Yeates, Esq. for the behoof of some charitable and literary institutions in that city. Mansion Housesj Sfc. â€” Ardmaddy Castle is one of the seats of the Marquis of Breadalbane, where the family have beea in the habit of residing for some weeks, during the summer season^ for the last few years* It is situated on the mainland at the head of a fine bay, and commands an extensive prospect of sea and land. The castle^ which is a very old building, stands on an eminence of a conical shape^ which has the appearance of an artificial mound. It was theresidenceof afamilyof the M^Dougallsi when that clan was in possession of the greatest part of Lorn. It was occupied in the time of persecution, during the reign of Charles ILandof his brother James, by Lord Niel Campbell, a brother of the Earl of Argyle, who was put to death in 1685. He made som^ additions to the former building. His own initials and those of his Lady (Cathe* rine Kerr,) are cut in a stone in one of the gables, N. C, C. E., 1676. Lord Niel himself was also a sufferer in those times of tyranny and blood. There is a small cave in the face of a rock, at a short distance from Ardmaddy, where it is said he used to conceal himself from his pursuers. In this castle, the late Mar- quis of Breadalbane was born in 1762. It was then occupied by his fitther Colin Campbell, Esq. of Carwhin, the presumptive heir to the title and estates of the Breadalbane family, and whose memory is still held in the greatest veneration throughout the whole district of Nether Lorn. The only other mansion house in the parish, is that built at Ardincaple, by the grandfather of the present proprietor about fifty years ago. It is now occupied by Dr Archibald Smith, who resided mauy years in Lima, and is the author of the able and interesting work entitled '* Peru as it is." BegiOers^^^There is a volume of session records beginning with the year 1 753^ and continued, though not very regularly kept, till 1798Â« Owing to some cause not well explained, the following voÂ« lume was lost or destroyed twenty years ago. The parish regis- ter has been regularly kept since the induction of Mr Beith in 1826. Antiquities. â€” The only remains of antiquity in the parish are the ruins of some old forts, so common in the Highlands. There is one of these on the top of a hill in the Island of Luing. It is of a circular form, built of dry stones, and was apparently a place Digitized by Google KILBRANDON AND KILCHATTAN. 75 of great strength, as the wall is about ten feet thick. There is another in Torsay, called the Castle of Dogs, and supposed to have been a hunting seat of the McDonalds. IIL â€” Population, Nothing is known of the ancient state of the population of this parish ; but from the number of churches in the times of Popery, it must have been very considerable. The population in 1755 was 1498 1772, 1750 1793, 2060 1801, 2278 1811, 2327 1821, 2644 1831, 2833 The increase in the population has been chiefly owing to the great number of people who are employed in the slate quarries. Character J Â§t?. of the People. â€” The people of this parish, who, with the exception of a few families, consist entirely of the labour- ing classes, are very intelligent and industrious. They are de- cidedly superior, in point of knowledge, to the population of most of our Highland parishes, and their moral character is in general very correct and regular. Those employed in the quarries cannot perhaps save much money ; but as they are supplied with a pro* vision for themselves and their families, though in debt to the Company, they are, upon the wbole^ in somewhat comfortable cirÂ« cumstances. The Gaelic language is universally spoken by all the natives of this district. The people in general can understand and speak English tolerably well ; but they have a great predilection for their mother tongue. There are scarcely a dozen people in the whole parish* who do not understand Gaelic, and these are strangers from the south. Mr John Whyte, the engineer of the slate works, who is an elder in the Established Church, and teaches one of the Sabbath schools, has, during the last three winters, delivered a course of lectures on mechanics in the Gaelic language. The people in general, and especially the young men at Easdale, seem to appro* ciate his laudable and gratuitous efforts for imparting to them use* ful and interesting knowledge. It is believed that this is the 6rst attempt that has been made to communicate such knowledge to the Highlanders in their own language. Lord Breadalbane, to whose liberality this parish is so much indebted in many respects, has lately presented this infant institution with an air-pump, to Digitized by Google 76 AUGYLESHIttE. enable Mr Whyte to illustrate some of his subjects to greater ad- vantage. IV. â€” Industry. Agriculture. â€” The state of husbandry in this part of the coun- try has been gneatly improved of late years. A considerable ex- tent of waste land has been brought into a state of cultivation, and much has been done in rendering what was formerly arable more productive. The Marquis of Breadalbane gives great en- couragement to his tenants and crofters in improving their lands by draining, ditching, and the work is done at the mutual expense of landlord and tenants, under the superintendence of an overseer, who lines out the drains and sees them properly executed, and then values the work done. From one-half to two-thirds is cre- dited to the tenants in their rents. The drains are made of va- rious dimensions, according to the nature of the ground. In some places, they are built and covered with flags, and in others they are 6lled entirely with small stones. In tilly and mossy land, they are cut according to the thorough draining system, but where spring water is found rising at the foot of banks, drains of from four to six feet deep are often made, and found to be very eifec- tivew The general stock consists of black-cattle of the west Highland breed, of which there are excellent folds in the parish selected and attended to with great care. There are only two or three sheep stocks, which are mostly of the black* faced kind, and of me- dium quality. There was an Agricultural Society established on the lands of the Marquis, five years ago, and annual competitions are held for black-cattle and sheep, at which premiums are awarded to the best. Premiums are also given to the best ploughmen, and for the best kept horses and harness, and for the best plots of turnips, a crop hitherto much neglected, but which, it is expected, will soon be grown more extensively. His Lordship gives prizes also to those cottars and small tenants who have the best managed gar- dens. The good effects of these encouragements are already very evident. The arable land rents, according to quality, from L.1 to L*2, 5s. per acre, Scots. The average rent of the mere grazing of a cow is from L.2 to L.8 ; of a sheep, from Ss. to 4s. The rate of w^es is from Is. 4d. to 2s. to day labourers ; and from 2s. to 2s. Digitized by Google KILBRANDON AND KILCHATTAN. 77 6dÂ« to artisans. Hired farm-servants receive from L. 8 to L.12 in the year ; women from L.4 to L.6. Tiie leases are of various duration upon the larger farms, and most of the smaller possessions are held at will from year to year. The whole tenantry on Lord Breadalbane's pro|)erty hold their lands under regular heads of lease, whether from year to year or for a longer period,-â€” and even those who have their tenants at will, have no hesitation in signing these, knowing that so long as they conduct themselves properly and pay their rents, no other person will get their possessions. A five course rotation is pre- scribed for farms, and a four course for crofts, â€” in targe posses* sions a six course rotation is reckoned preferable. A rule established by Lord Breadalbane on his property, with regard to cottars, has had an excellent effect in protecting them from oppression on the part of the tenants, and might be adopted with great advantage on other large Highland estates. No ten- ant isallowed either to take in or to remove cottars without his Lord- ship's permission, and those who are poor hold their houses and gardens rent free. As to those cottars who are in circumstances to pay rent, a certain sum is fixed by direction of the factor on the estate, as the value of the house and garden, beyond which the tenant cannot make any demand. And the cottar is not bound to work for the tenant a single day, if he prefers to pay cash, which leaves him free to find labour, wherever it is most to his advantage. The rent of a house and garden is from 15s. to dOs., according to the value and the ability of the cottar to pay. This is a complete check to that thraldom to which cottars are subjected, whan left to the uncontrolled will of a merciless tenant, who would exact from them their labour during the greater part of the year, giving them no- thing more than a small piece of potato ground in addition to the house and garden. Quarries and Mines. â€” The ISasdale slate quarries are the only works in the parish of this description. The quality of the rock is known to be very superior, and of great durability. The for- mation is very similar to that of the Welsh slate works, as de- scribed by Professor Sedgwick, so far as regards the distortions of the sedimentary bed ; and it is surprising with what accuracy the quarriers can trace the different stones, or layers, through thin distorted beds, after sinking and again reappearing. These quarries have been wrought for nearly two centuries, and they are still carried on very extensively. Upwards of 200 Digitized by Google 78 ARGTLBSHIUE. men are employed in tfaem^ producing from four to fire millions of slate annually. Under the superintendence of the present ma- nager, James Robertson, Esq. the improvements made in machin- ery have been taken advantage of in these works. The labour, formerly done by horses and carts, and wheelbarrows, is now per- formed by steam-engines and railroads. There are, altogether, four quarries wrought at present, viz. the principal one at Easdale, one at Balvicar in Soil, and two in Luing. One quarry at Easdale is 120 (set below the level of the sea. The quarriers are paid for the slates at certain rates per thousand. They generally earn from LÂ»dO to L.85 each in the year. The men employed in cleaning out the slate rubbish are paid at the rate of Is. 3d. to Is. 8d. per day. In Luing and Soil, there are appearances of lead ore and zinc, but these have not yet been discovered in such quantity as to encourage the working. There is also a marble quarry near Ardmaddy, which was wrought for some time, but has been discontinued, being found unprofitable. Fisherieg. â€” The herring fishing was at one time very productive on this coast; but of late years, those who follow this occupation have not been very successful. At the south end of Luing, how- ever, considerable quantities are taken with the fly in May and June, and sell at a high price. Last year. Lord Breadalbane gave Knes to about forty of the Luing people, for the purpose of encou- raging them to fish for cod and ling. It is hoped their endeavours will be successful, as this sort of fishing has been too much ne- glected in this quarter. V. â€” Parochial Economy. Marhet^Towfu â€” The nearest market town is Oban, which is sixteen miles to the north. ViBageM. â€” There are five villages in the parish, the largest of which is I^dale. This village is built on both sides of the Sound of Easdale, and contains a population of about 800 individuals. The houses of the quarriers are only one story high, and slated, and they all have a neat and comfortable appearance. All the steamers which ply between Glasgow and the northern ports pass through the Sound of Easdale. There is thus a frequent and speedy conveyance both to the north and south. The following note was taken in 1826, of all the vessels that entered the Har- bour of Easdale in the course of a twelvemonth: 7 brigs, 15 Digitized by Google KILBRANDON AND KlLCHATTAN. 79 schooners, 5 galliots, 254 sloops, and 245 steamers, including their repeated trips. Here might be seen, some years ago, (1828), the engineer of the work plying his little bark across the sound, propelled by the Archimedes screw.* This ingenious piece of mechanism was his own invention. In this village there is an inn, several shops, and a post-office. There is a daily post beÂ« tween Easdale and Oban. The other villages are, Balvicar in Seil, Toberonochy, Millbay, and Colipol in Luing. All these have been built in the vicinity of slate quarries ; and, as some of these quarries are not wrought to any extent, being found unproductive, many of the inhabitants of these villages are often ill supplied with employment. Roods. â€” The parish is well supplied with roads and ferries. The public road from Oban enters the parish from the north- east, at Clachan Bridge. It passes through the centre of Seil and Luing. There are several cross roads, which are kept in good repair. Eeeknastical State. â€” The church is situated in the centre of the parish, at the south end of the Island of Seil, close to the Ferry of Cuan. It was built about one hundred years ago, and ac- commodates 600 sitters. No seat rents are exacted. All the people, except the inhabitants of Seil, have to cross a ferry, and some of them more than one in coming to church, which circumstance, in bad weather, prevents their attending regularly. In good weather, the church is always crowded. Taking into account the lai^e population and the obstructions by ferries, there is scarcely a parish in the Highlands or Islands of Scotland, where an addi- tional* church is more required. The great body of the people belong to the Established Church. The number of communicants in about 400. The number of Dissenters in the parish, as reported to the Church Commissioners in 1836, was 200. They belong chiefly to the Covenanters and Independents. There are two persons belonging to the Baptists, and one Roman Catholic family. Dis- sent in this district has been owing entirely to the abuse of pa- tronage in former times. The manse is sufficiently large and commodious. It was built in 1827. Before that time, there was no manse in the parish. * Mr John Wbyte*s claims to this invention are stated in a letter addressed by him to the Editor of the Scottish Guardian Newspaper, and inserted in that Journal of date the 26th June 1840. Digitized by Google dl) ARGYLESmBR. The former miDisters used to occupy a large farm at a low rent, the farm-house serviog fur a manse, aixU by this means, the old glebe, which was of some value, has been lost to the church. The present glebe contains very little arable land, except a piece of reclaimed mossÂ« Its value may be about L.15 a-year* The stipend is the minimum. The sum of L.14Â» Os. 8d. is annually received out of the Exchequer. Edacation. â€” There are generally eight schools in operation in this parish during the winter months. These were attended in 1840 by 6:25 scholars. There are also five Sabbath schools, which are all well attended. There are two parochial schoolmas* ters. The schoolmaster of Kilbrandon, who resides in Soil, has the maximum salary of L.34 a year, with a dwelling-house and garden. The other, who resides in Luing, receives L.25 a year, with a schooUhouse and garden, but without a dwelling-house ; but he rents a croft on which a comfortable house was lately built^ partly at his own expense. There are two remote localities where the respective proprietors give L.5 a year to enable the people to employ a teacher. In the populous island of Easdale, there is a school supported by the Society for Propagating Christian Know- ledge. The salary is L.15, with L.d for an assistant during win- ter. There are three other schools on the teachers' own adven* ture. The branches taught in these schools are English and Gaelic reading, writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping. The pa- rochial schoolmasters teach Latin, navigation, and mathematics when required. The school fees are, for reading, ^s. per quarter ,* with writing, Ss. ; arithmetic, 4s. ; Latin, ds. The people in general make great efforts to give some education to their children ; but many of them, from their poverty, are obliged to withdraw their children from school before they hare made any great progress, and send them to earn something for themselves. Owing to the same causey the school fees are not well paid ; so that those teachers who are without an endowment cannot be ex- pected to be very efficient. Lord Breadalbane gives an annual sum for prizes, which are awarded at a public competition of all the schools in the parish, and which tends very much to stimulate and encourage both teachers and scholars; but, without some adequate endowment, there can be no great improvement in many of the schools in this district. Poor and Parochial Funds* â€” The number of poor upon the roll Digitized by Google KILBRANDON AND KILCHATTAN. 81 is 108. A few more receive occasional aid. Those on the roll have received, for some years past, from 10s. to L.1, 5s. each in the year, according to their necessities. The church collections, with other dues, amount to about Lfo20 a year. The Marquis of Breadalbane gives very liberal donations, which enable the kirk-session to give the sums above-mentioned to the poor. His Lordship also allows small pensions to some aged and reduced tenants. The superannuated quarriers are chiefly supported by a ' fund of their own, arising from a nominal rent of 5s. annually paid for their houses and gardens. The Easdale Slate Company give a monthly allowance of meal to disabled quarriers and tl^ir fami- lies. \ Savings Bank. â€” Under the patronage of Lord Breadalbane, a Savings bank was established at Easdale, two years ago ; but it is now merged in the National Security Savings' Bank at Oban. It is hoped, when its advantages are better understood, that the class of people for whose benefit it has been established, will avail themselves of the opportunity thus afforded them of making some provision for the time of sickness and old age. Pud* â€” The quarriers at Easdale are all supplied with coals from Glasgow at the rate of 18s. per ton. The farmers generally use peats, which were, at one time, very plentiful in these islands, and easily i^cured ; but are now becoming rather scarce, particu- larly in the island of Seil. My ld4a ARGTLE. Digitized by Google PARISH OF GLENURCHY & INISHAIL. PRESBYTERY OF LORN, SYNOD OF ARGYLE. THE REV. DUNCAN MACLEAN, MINISTER. I. â€” Topography and Natural History. Names. â€” The parish of Glennrchy, â€” so called from the valley in which it chiefly lies, and the river which flows through it, â€” was of old known by the nanie of Clachan an disart The valley it- self takes its name from the river Urchay, which, issuing from a small lake in the braes or upland part of the parish, traverses a great part of it ; and, after a run of sixteen miles, empties itself in Lochawe, close to the ruins of Caolchurn Castle. The parish stiH retains its ancient name in all ecclesiastical deeds and records. All the minutes of session are uniformly dated at Clachan an disart The name, as stated in the former report, signifies tAe temple or sanctuary of the Supreme Being* Tradition alleges, that Dniid- ism, of old, occupied the spot on which the church now stands ; that her clachan or circle of stones stood, and that her detestable mysteries were celebrated, on the hallowed spot whither the mul- titudes now go up to worship the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Inishail, the conjoined parish, derives its appellation from an island of the same name in Lochawe, and on which stood the pa- rish church, from the Reformation till the year 1736, when it was transferred to its present site. The ruins of the old church are still visible, as are those of a nunnery said to have been of the Cister- tian order. Close by these interesting ruins lies a burying ground, on which some of the grave stones furnish beautiful specimens of ancient sculpture. Inishail, according to some, signifies the beaufi-; fid island^ and is so called on account of its superiority in this re- spect to the neighbouring islands. According to others, it signifies the Island of St Paul^ because it was, as is supposed, dedicated, with the religious establishment that stood upon it, to that distin- guished apostle, â€” in contradistinction to the island of Inishdruinicb, Digitized by Google OLBNURCHT AND INISHAIL. 83 or the Isle of Druids, in its close neigbbourbood. According to others, it signifies the Island of Paul, viz. Paul the Treasurer of Scotland, or, as he is called in Gaelic, Paul an Sporain, the found- er of the noble house of Argyle, who is said to have been buried here ; whilst, according to a fourth party, and in accordance with a still current tradition, it signifies the Island of Aillidh, or the beautiful, a daughter of a King of Denmark, whose remains are said to be interred here. Extent and Boundaries. â€” The extreme length of the parish, from the shores of Lochetive at Bunawe, on the west, to the bor- ders of Perthshire, near Tyndrum, in Breadalbane, on the east, is from 24 to 25 miles. Its breadth is various and unequal, rang- ing from 5 to 20 miles. Its average breadth is about 12 miles. Number of square miles, about 300. It is bounded on the east, by the parish of Killin ; on the west, by the parishes of luverary, Kilchrenan, and Muckairn, and for a short space by Lochetive ; on the south, by the parishes of Kilmorick,. Inverary, and Arro- char ; and on the north-west and north, by the parishes of Ard- chattan and Appin ; and on the north-east, near the confines of Rannoch, by the parish of Fortingal. Topographical Appearances, â€” The principal range of mountains in the parish may be designated the Cruachan range, which stretches along the north and north-east side of the parish, rear- ing up its gigantic masses, and forming a formidable barrier, between Glenurchy and the counterminous parishes of Ardchat- tan and Appin. This range embraces several mountains of great elevation, such as Beinabhuiridh, or hill of routing; Stob an daimh, or the stot'^s peak ; Bein Macmonaidh, or mountain son of the hill ; and Bein dourain, or the mountain of ottars, â€” a moun- tain dear to the Highland muse, and rendered immortal by the most distinguished of our later Highland bards, the pre-eminently poetical, though illiterate Duncan Ban M^Intyre. In the parish of Inishail, there are no hills of any great height. The only range which occurs, is that which separates it from the parish of Inverary, a great part of which comes, with greater propriety, under the designation of moor, than either of hill or mountain. This range, which stretches away from the westward to the eastern extremity of Lochawe, extends along the south side of the vale of the Ur- chay, â€” forming, by its comparative insipidity and tameness, a marked and striking contrast to the steep, rugged, and lofty Digitized by Google 84 ARGYLESHIRE. summits of Cruachan, and the lone and lovely green corries and valleys which they overhang and overshadow. This range of hills, or rather moors, terminate at length at the base of Meali nan Tighearnan, viz. the hill of the chiefs^ and Beinachleidh, two of the offshoots and buttresses of Beinlaoidb, or mountain of fawns, Beinlaoidh is unquestionably the loftiest mountain in the parish, (Bein Cruachan being situate in the pa* rish of Ardchattan,) and although now denuded and shorn of the woods which even at a comparatively recent period clothed and adorned its sides, it is one of the most elegant of mountains in a dis- trict in which it is no easy matter to adjust the competing claims of a host of rivals for this distinction. This constitutes the western extremity of a chain of mountains which stretches eastward, form- ing the southern boundary of the parish of Killin, including in the number the towering and gigantic Bein* More and Bein- Ann* The Cruachan chain is occasionally broken and interrupted by interjacent corries and valleys. In the number of the latter, we may place Glenstrae, at one period the homestead and fastness of the chief of the brave but persecuted and proscribed Clan Gregor. The valley which gives its name to the parish, is another. The former, which lies immediately at the base of the principal off- shoot of Cruachan, is separated from the latter by a ridge of hills of comparatively low elevation, whilst this, in its turn, is separated from Glenlochay, a long winding valley, (through which lies the line of communication with Perthshire,) by anoUier range of hills of still lower elevation. These three valleys open from the east and north-east on that part of Glenurchy which the natives call the Strath, or plain. Glenlochay runs nearly eastward, with a bend or inclination to the north. Glenurchy proper, which lies north of the other, and which inclines in the same way, opens up a communication with Inverness-shire, by the Black Mount, and the much admired and celebrated Glencoe. The river UrÂ« chay, after receiving the waters of the Lochay, at a point two miles east from the church, now swollen into a beautiful river, winds its course through the Strath, forming several beautiful islands as it advances, amongst others that on which stand the church and manse, and which forms the better part of the minis- ter's glebe, â€” until, having received the waters of the Strae, it dis- charges itself at length into the magnificent Lochawe, close to the base of the ruins of Caolchurn. Cavesy 4'c.â€” 'The only cave of any interest is that in which Digitized by Google GLENURCHY AND INISHAIL. 85 MacFadyen sought refuge after his defeat by Wallace at the pass of Brauder, aud where he was dragged out and executed. It is still pointed out as MacFadyeu's Cave, in the face of Craig an Araidh, as is the stone on which he stood to breathe a little in the middle of the Awe after his defeat, and from which, after relieving himself of his armour, and, throwing it into tbe river, he plunged into the stream, and, amid showers of darts, he gained the opposite bank. The stone is still called MacFadyen's stone, and as such is pointed out to the stranger. The parish has not above three-fourths of a mile of sea coast altogether : this is at Bunawe. The character of the shore is sandy. Hydrography. â€” The principal lakes in the parish are Lochawe and Lochtolla. The latter is situated in the braes of Glenurchy. It is but a small, yet a lovely sheet of water. It is about four miles in length, and its average breadth is a mile. On the north side, at Ardvrecknish, the Marquis of Breadalbane, sole proprietor of Glenurchy, has a shooting-lodge set down in the centre of his vast deerrforest of Corichbad. The lodge, with its young thriving plantations, contrasts beautifully with the ptneÂ«wood forest of Derridarroch on the opposite shore of the lake, and lends, with its exciting associations of deer, and hounds, and huntsmen, a high, degree of interest to this lone and solitary mountain tarn. The parish stretches westward, on both sides of Lochawe, eight miles. This, beyond controversy, is one of the noblest and love* Kest of Scotland's lakes. Its length is variously estimated. It is somewhere between twenty-four and thirty miles. Its breadth is very unequal, expanding in some places and contracting in others. It may be averaged at a mile, excepting towards its eastern extre- mity, where its principal charms and attractions lie, and where it expands into a breadth of three miles. Its depth varies in different places. It is in some places seventy fathoms deep. It is said to be very deep along the base of Cruachan, and at the gorge of the magnificent pass by which its waters effect their escape, and urge their turbulent and noisy career to Lochetive. This noble sheet of water is far from being so generally known, admired, and frequent- ed, as its superior claims would justly authorize to expect The upper or eastern end, that which lies in this parish, is decided- ly, in point of historical interest and scenic beauty, far superior to the other.

Here stood the Hesperides of Ossian ; and here, mortally wounded by the monster dragon that guarded the forbidden fruit, perished the chivalrous and youthful Traoch, â€” but not ere his venomous foe pe* rished under his powerful arm.*^ It is alleged that the tenure by which Sir Gilbert and his heirs held his castle and neighbouring possessions from his sovereign, was, that he should give him be6t- ting entertainment in the event that he should ever claim it, special provision being made that the king should be accommodated with a bed of clean straw.f The key of this ancient stronghold, which was, for many centuries, the property and residence of Macdhono. chie of Inverawe, was picked up among the ruins, not many years ago, by a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who recently handed it over to Campbell of Monzie, the present proprietor, who has it now in his possession. Much superior in point of extent, and certainly in nowise infe- rior in any other respect, either to this or any other ruin in the Highlands of Scotland, and at a distance of about five miles east* ward, at the extremity of the lake, stands Caolchurn Castle, now in ruins, still the property, and, for centuries, one of the many re* sidences and fortresses of the noble family of Breadalbane. This magnificent pile is based upon a rock, which is said to have been, at the time of its erection, an island.

On the north side, Bein-cruachan, separated from you by the narrow channel of the Urchay, which partly gives the castle its name, and is beautifully wooded midway up its summit, rears his lofty brow, until it is enveloped amid the clouds of heaven. On the south, and separated from you by a narrow bay, rise the beautiful knolls of Ardteatle and Kenchraikin, â€” here skirted with wood, there mantled with heath and green breckon, â€” with their lovely glades opening between, the favourite haunt of the hare and the roe. In front of the castle opens, towards the north-east, the bleak, dark, and frowning Glenstrae ; and, towards the south-east, and in mar- vellous and striking contrast, the verdant, soft, and smiling strath and vale of Urchay, terminating at the base of the lofty and coni- cal Beinlaoidh. In the centre of this beautiful panorama, em- bowered in wood, partial glimpses may be obtained of the manse, and parish church, and inn, awaking far other emotions from those excited by the castellated pile from which the survey is made, apH whence the eye roams delighted over the noble and lovely scenes that open away on either hand. Caolchurn Castle, at once the memorial and chronicler 6f the feudal power and grandeur of the noble family which still owns it, is said to have been, before it came into its possession, the residence and stronghold of MacGregor, Laird of Glenur- chy. A tradition exists, that, before it came into the posses- sion, either of the Clan Campbell or Clan Gregor, it was the residence of an ancient tribe, now no longer existing in the paÂ«> rish, of the name of Paterson ; and that, while in their posses- sion, it was designated the White House of Eilaineolain. It came, together with the lordship of Glenurchy, into the posses- sion of the family of Breadalbane, either in the close of the reign of James II. or in the beginning of the reign of his successor. It is highly probable that the Clan Gregor, along with the neigh<> bouring Clans of M^Nab and M'Naughtan, became involved in the wars of Bruce and Baliol, and that their castles and lands be- came the reward of the distinguished services of the Knights of Lochawe. It was bestowed, with other appendages, as his patri* Digitized by Google 88 ARGTLESHIBE. mony, by Sir Duncan, the twelfth knight, on his second son, Sir Colin, Knight of Rhodes, or, as he is called by Highland Shea^ nachies, Caiiean dubh na Rdimh^ the founder of the house of Breadalbane ; and hence the patronymic designation of this noble family is Mac Caillein mhic Dhonoehaidh^ or Colin son of Duncan. He partly rebuilt and enlarged the castle. Tradition gi?es his * lady credit for the erection of the great tower or donjon of the castle. She, it is said, occupied herself thus, during Sir Colin's absence in the Holy Land. The date of its erection was 1440. It received several additions at different subsequent periods. The south side is said to have been built, during the fifteenth century ; and the north, which exceeds the rest in spaciousness and ele- gance, was built by the first Earl of Breadalbane in the year 16 15.* The noble family occasionally occupied it till about a century ago. About seventy years ago, in the absence, and without the privity of its noble proprietor, and with a view, it is said, to a paltry saving of expense, it was unroofed, and its materials used, not, as has been alleged,! in the erection of Tayniouth Castle, but of farm-houses and offices in the parish. This hastened its decay prematurely. It is lovely in its ruins, and intensely interesting from the records of other times connected with it. The pass of Brandir, whilst its sublime scenery is greatly en- hanced in point of interest, by many historical recollections and associations,! is, independently of all these, one of the most magni- ficent which the Highlands present It is by this mountain pass that the waters of Lochawe effect their escape to the sea. The north side is formed by the massy, abrupt, and rocky, yet well- wooded base of Cruachan, which rises in some places like a per- pendicular wall from the water, and which, until the present line of road was executed, rendered it impassable to any except the sure-footed anci steady-headed mountaineer. Even he had, at one place, still known by the name of the ladder rock, to climb up by a ladder, as the name would intimate, the face of a bold and precipitous rock, which then shot down its masses abrupt to the water edge. This formidable barrier has, at length, yielded to hu- man might and ingenuity; and its removal has given access to scenes nowhere .surpassed, either in point of loveliness or grandeur, and rendered the sea at Bunawe accessible to the mountaineer for ex- porting his produce to southern markets. The south side of the pass â€¢ Vide General Stevrart'k History of Highland Regiments, t See Bridal of Caolchurn. \ See Blind Harry. Digitized by Google GLENURCHY AND INISHAIL; 89 is formed by the bold, rugged, and overhangiDg rocks of Craigand- avuaidh, now completely shorn of its once rich garniture of wood. At the gap, or upper part, and only distinguished for a space from its parent lake by its narrowed and contracted dimensions, the Awe steals slowly and silently along, until at length, as if alive to the blessings of freedom, it rushes rapidly, foaming, and thunder* ing along its rocky bed, till, after a short but rapid career of four miles through its own lovely valley, it empties itself in Lochetive at Bunawe. The only rivers in the parish worthy of the name, are the Urchay and the Awe. The circumstance that the former escapes from its reservoir in a lateral direction, is rather a singular and anomalous one in the history of rivers. It is believed that it holds almost universally true, that their outlet is at the extremity of their parent lake, and not, as in this instance, at the side. It is the current belief, that the Awe, at a remote period, formed no ex- ception to this general rule, that Lochawe discharged its waters by its western extremity into the sea at Loch Crinan. The foundation on which this belief rests, is partly a faint and dying tradition in the country to this effect, and the names of some loca- lities in the supposed line of its ancient channel, and the level, open nature of the valley that stretches away towards Loch Crinan from the western extremity of the lake, together with the anoma â€¢ lous character of its present outlet. The run of the Awe, as al- ready stated, is short, although the volume of its water is great, as compared with that of most Highland rivers. Its breadth va- ries according to the nature of the bed over which it runs ; from two to three hundred feet, may be a fair average. Its direction is north-west. It is, generally speaking, a shallow stream; al- though pools occasionally occur of considerable depth. Its flow is very rapid ; indeed, until it approaches Lochetive, it may be describ- ed as a series of small rapids and puny cataracts. The Urchay^ whose source, length, and character, have been already in some de- gree described, is, like its neighbour, an exceedingly beautiful river,, and like it of considerable value on account of its. salmon fishings.* It may lay claim to a greater variety of character than its neighbour. Its flows from the parent lake for a space of six miles, rapid and turbulent ; and at one place, Caitnish, it descends by a suc- cession of bounds or leaps of considerable height, to the more level part of the valley ; and thereafter, although occasionally assum- ing its former character, it meandeni silently along, until at length Digitized by Google 90 ARGYLESHinF. it loses iUelf iu Locliawe* Its breadth may average that of the Awe. It is generally shallow, until it approaches the termioatioD of its course, when it acquires a much greater depth, and becomes slow and sluggish in its motion, as if unwilling to mingle its waters with those of the lake. It is a lovely stream, and in exquisite keeping with the ever-varying yet ever-beautiful scenery through which it flows, and of which it constitutes so very essential an ele- ment, and prominent a feature. It presents no falls of any great magnitude. Those of Gait* nish are chiefly interesting, from the grotesque and fantastic shapes into which the incessant action of the water has moulded the rock over which it urges its noisy and angry career. Geology and Mineralogy. â€” The greatest part of the parish is composed of stratified rocks of the primary series. Mica slate and gneiss chiefly prevail. Both these rocks change into one an- other very gradually, so that it is difficult to decide where the one ends and the other begins. The mica slate receives felspar into its composition, and if the felspar increases so far as to equal or exceed the quartz and mica, gneiss is formed. Gneiss occupies the most northern parts of the district, and is most fully developed at Bendourain and LochtoUa. The bearing of the strata is fix)m north-east to south-west, almost parallel with the direction of the Grampians. Gneiss and mica slate, especially the latter, include subordin- ate strata of talc, chlorite, hornblende slate and clay slate, and lime- stone. The limestone, however, is not found in a very pure state, but much mixed with mica and quartz, so as to appear as mica slate, where the quartz is supplanted by lime. Limestone occurs near the manse on the banks of the Urchay, and a bed of it ex- tends westward for miles from the farm of Sockoch in Glenorchy, along the face of the range of hills that divides the parish from Kilchrenan and Inverary. Igneous rocks appear on a large scale at Black mount and near Lochawe. Granite and porphyry are the chief representa- tives of those rocks. Granite occupies a large space at Black* mount, Glenetive, and Glenc6. It is highly crystalline; its relation to porphyry is remarkable. The porphyry, being imper- fectly crystallized granite, is found in veins in the perfect granite, and projects also occasionally in fissures in the neighbouring mica slate and gneiss. The igneous rocks, granite, and porphyry have altered the nearest strata of schist; the mica is found melted, and Digitized by Google GLENURCHY AND INISHAIL. 91 the position, moreover, of the strata is seen to be altered, and their dipping is irregular. This change of position of the stratified rocks has affected the formation of valleys in the district, more es- pecially those occupied by lakes, as Lochtolla and Lochavre, where deep rents or fissures have been caused by the disturbance of the strata* Greenstone and syenite seldomer occur in veins in mica-slate, but when they do, they are found partly parallel with the bearing of that rock, and partly intersecting it, running from north north- east to south south-west* Beautiful syenite is found in the farm of Auch on Benbuy, north of Tighandrom. Abundant veins of quartz intersect the stratified rocks, carrying often lead glance, and that in so abnndant quantity, as to constitute an object of min- ing speculation* The bearing of the veins is in general from north north*east to south south-west, one vein only with lead runs pa* rallel with the strata. This vein occurs near Arivean. Large quartz dikes are found parallel with the smaller veins. These project above the surface in high walls, and extend for many miles in unbroken continuous lines, across hills and valleys* In these dikes, the quartz is quite compact, and includes no other mineral, â€” in some instances, however, their continuation becomes of a softer nature, and carries lead ore* In cases of this kind, those veins are not seen rising above the neighbouring strata. Some quartz veins contain pyrites, which mineral is very abundant in the layers of quartz belonging to the formation of mica-schist There is no great variety of minerals in the district, besides those com- posing the rocks ; as quartz, mica^ felspar, talc, chlorite, horn- blende and limestone. The following are the extraneous minerals^ viz* lead glance, zinc, blende iron, copper pyrites, red iron oxyd, chramate of iron in small quantities in talc rock on the south side of Benlaoidh, in the farm of Sockoch, plumbago supplanting mica in mica-schist, and also found in talc schist, calc and felspar, and seldom heavy spar* Perfect crystals of these minerals are very rare* Zoology. â€” There are no animals of peculiar rarity in the parish* It abounds in deer, roe, and hare, and all kinds of game. The deer forest of Black Mount, the greater part of which lies in Glen- orchy, is supposed to contain from 2000 to 3000 red-deer. The fox is an inhabitant of the parish, despite of every effort made to destroy him, as is the pole-cat, martin and weasel, and wild- cat* Digitized by Google 92 ARGYLESHIRE* Various kinds of fisb abound in all our lakes, especially in Lochawe, viz. salmon, different kinds of trout, some of which, in point of size, equal an ordinary-sized salmon, eel, char, now rather a scarce 6sh, perch and pike. The pike is only of recent impor* tation ; and it is greatly feared, that the character of the lake will suffer from the ravages of this active and. voracious fish. The small lakes in the braes teem with the fish, though they are, gene- rally speaking, of a small size. Botany. â€” At a period, comparatively recent, the greater part of our moors and valleys, and the sides of our mountains, midway to their summits, were clothed with trees of various kinds. The braes of the parish, a district of great extent, and the valleys of the Urchay, the Strae and the Lochay, were clothed with a dense and magnificent forest, partly of oak, birch, ash, and alder, but chiefly of pine. Some scanty remains of these once mighty forests are still to be seen in different localities in the parish, viz. Cranich, Doiridarroch, Glenfuath, Correhorri, and Coirre Vicar. They were leased out, about a century ago, to an Irish company, who felled an immense quantity of timber, which they floated down the Urchay, when in flood, to the head of Loch Awe, where it was hewn into planks, and then floated down Loch Awe in rafb to the pass of Brander ; whence it was carted down to the sea, and ship- ped at Bunawe. This, it is said, proved a bad speculation for all parties concerned. It sealed the fate of those noble forests which, for many years, were neglected, and which, consequently, hastened to premature decay. The stumps and roots of these once magnificent trees are now dug up by the mountain shepherd and forester, for the double purpose of supplying him with light and fuel. The quality of the timber was very superior. It was found, at the time of stripping Caolchu^n castle, that is, after the lapse of three centuries, perfectly fresh and free of moth and rot It was, in point of quality, equal to the best Baltic timber. The last remains of the pine- forest of Glenstrae was cut down thirty- five years ago, and employed in the erection of the parish church, the timber of which is exceedingly, and justly admired. Some of the trees were of an enormous size. Whilst the pine seems to have been the prevalent tree, the oak failed not to prefer bis claim to sovereignty. There are some oak trunks, of enormous size, to be seen in our rivers and mosses. There is one below Achallader, which, till of late, when the river, which it spanned, shifted its channel, served for a bridge ; and there are trunks of a prodigious 4 Digitized by Google GLENURCHY AND INISHAIL. 93 size, to be seen in the Auchay below the farm of Stroomil chain. Large oaks have been recently dug up in the close vicinity of the house of New Inverawe ; and trunks of a very large size may, when the lake is low, be seen along the shores of Lochawe. Besides these valuable kinds of trees, our mountains and valleys were clothed, as they are partially still, with oak copice and birch, the aspen, the ash, and elm, and the ever-green holly. But these, ge-> nerally speaking, are rapidly disappearing ; and our mountains, and valleys, and straths have become comparatively naked and bare. The vale of the Urchay, though comparatively denuded of its an- cient garniture, is, notwithstanding, well-wooded, both with na- tural and plantation timber; and every possible attention is paid thereto by its noble proprietor. The same remark applies with equtfl justice and propriety to the woods of Inverawe, Rookhill, and Inishdrynich. II. â€” Civil History. The introduction of sheep constitutes an era of great importance in the history of this, as of almost every other Highland parish. It effected, everywhere in the Highlands, a complete revolution in the condition of the population. It snapped the tie which bound the occupant to the owner of the soil, and which began to be relaxed on the suppression of the Rebellion of 1745, which was attend- ed with the complete prostration and extinction of ihe hopes long indulged by the majority of the 'Highland chiefs of the elevation of the House of Stewart to the throne of their ancestors, and thus greatly lowered the vassal in the estimation of his chief. The an- ticipated result followed. Vast tracts of our straths and valleys, of our moors and mountains, exchanged stock and occupants. The deer and the goat gave place to the sheep ; and, in many instan- ces, the intelligent, well-educated, well-descended, and hospitable Highland tacksman, with his attached devoted cottars and depend- ents, gave way to the plodding industrious low country store farmer and shepherd. One or other of three alternatives was adopted by the unfortunate mountaineer, â€” that of removing to some of the manufacturing towns of the south,^-of emigrating to America, â€” or of contenting himself with a small patch of land, with the keep of a few cows, in some assigned locality in his native strath or valley. Emineni Men. â€” Glenorchy gave birth, at a comparatively re- cent period, to two highly gifted and distinguished individuals, brothers, riz. the late Rev. Dr John Smith of Campbelton, and Digitized by Google 94 ARGYLESHIRE. Donald Smith, M. D. While both excelled in general scholar- ship, they were, at the same time, pre-eminent for the extent, intimacy, and correctness of their acquaintance with their own vernacular tongue, and its cognate branches. Dr John Smith was a distinguished and most successful preacher, as well as an able scholar and divine. He has placed his countrymen under a lasting debt of gratitude by the distinguished share he took in translating the Scriptures into Gaelic His translation of the Prophecy of Isaiah will be held in admiration, as long as the language into which he rendered it endures, and as long as there is a Gaelic scholar found alive, who can appreciate its beau* ties. At the request of the Synod of Argyle, he published a re- vised and corrected version of the Psalms of David, which is de- servedly held in high estimation for the simplicity and purity of its language, and the easy, graceful, and harmonious flow of its versifi* cation. It is that which is in general use in the counties of Perth and Argyle. He published several professional works of great merit : also an Agricultural Survey of the county of Argyle, drawn up at the request, and for the information, of the Board of Agricul- ture, which proves him to have been a man of great and varied talent and information. He was born at Croft Brackly, and died at Campbelton in the year 1807. His brother was born at the same place in the year 1756, and died in Edinburgh in the year 1805.* On the 20th of March 1724, the parish gave birth to one who holds a pre-eminent place amongst the Highland bards of mo- dem times, Duncan M^Intyre, better known to his admiring countrymen by the distinctive appellation of Donacha ban nan dran, or fair^haired Duncan of the Lays, He was bom, on the farm of Druimliart, in the braes of the parish. His pa- * The following tribute to the character of this good man and eminent scholar, from the pen of the Convener of the Committee of the Highland Society, tii. Mr Henry Mackenzie, the author of the Man of Peeling, in intimating the death of Dr Smith to that distinguished body, will satislactorily show the high estimation in which he was held. *< It is with infinite concern the Committee has to inform the society of the death of its excellent ooac|jutor, Dr D. Smith who died, after a very short illness, on the very dayâ€” 22d Mayâ€” when the last of his labours in its service, the concluding sheet of this appendix, issued from the press. The Committee has to sympathize with every lover of Celtic literature on the loss of a scholar and antiquarian, whose extent of knowledge, whose acuteness, and whose industry have seldom been equalled. Its acquaintance with him, on occasion of compiling this report, induces the Committee to add another praise, not less great, nor less honourable, though of less general coo- cern, in its severe regrets for the loss of those many virtues and estimable qualities (not less estimable for the simple and unassuming manners that accompanied them,) which Dr Smith posseraed as a man.'* Digitized by Google GI.ENURCHY AND INISHAIL. 95 rents were in very humble circumstances. This fact, coupled with the great distance of their place of residence from the parish school, accounts for his utter ignorance of letters. He passed his early youth in agricultural and pastoral pursuits. Fowling and fishing, sports in which he excelled, challenged no inconsiderable portion of his time. It is clear, from his own writings, that he worked as a common farm-servant, and, according to his own ac- count, he excelled in this capacity. He bore arms in the year 1745 in the Ai^le Militia. He was ardently attached to the cause and fortunes of the chivalrous and unfortunate Prince Charles Edward,â€” and a staunch supporter of the principle of legitimacy. He was present and fought at the battle of Falkirk, of which he has given a graphic and somewhat humorous account, and in which he, like some other sons of song, left his sword and shield behind him. His poem on occasion of this battle is said to have been his first essay at poetry. On the suppression of the Rebellion, and consequent reduction of the corps in which he served, he returned to his native parish, and resumed the more congenial pursuits of the arts of peace. At that time, as now, a wide range of country, including a considerable part of Glenurchy, and of Glenurchy in the parish of KtUin, were under deer. Our poet became one of the sub-foresters. While thus employed, he produced the no- blest fruits of his genius, â€” his immortal songs of Beindourain, Coi'recheathaich, and Mairi bhan og. He afterwards served in the Breadalbane Fencibles from the year 1793 to the period of its re- duction in the year 1799. He attained to the great age of eighty- nine years. His remains lie interred, without any memorial, in the Canongate church-yard. He died in Edinburgh in the year 1812. Land'Ovmers. â€” The Marquis of Breadalbane is sole proprietor of the parish of Glenurchy. The parish of Inishail is divided among six proprietors, viz. the Duke of Argyle ; Campbell of Mon^ zie, as proprietor of Inverawe ; Campbell of Lochnell ; Campbell of Rockhill ; Campbell of New Inverawe ; and Mac Alister of In- chdrynich. Parochial Registers. â€” There are two registers kept in the parish, one in each division, in which the births and marriages, the distri- bution of the poor's fund, and cases of discipline are recorded. The oldest is a fragment of the register of baptisms, which has been em- bodied in that which constitutes the first volume of the Glenurchy register. The earliest entry is dated 1753. On the admission of Digitized by Google 96 ARGYLESHIRE. Dr M^Intyre in the year 1 765, .a suitable volume was provided, in which he recorded every parochial event and occurrence which be' deemed of any importance. The volume, however, has not been kept in the best preservation, nor does it furnish a very correct re- cord of baptisms and marriages. It is, notwithstanding, from the circumstance already stated, an interesting volume. The recofd of Inishail parish dates from the settlement of Dr M^Intyre. The kirk-session of Muckairn were, from time immemorial^ till of late, in the habit of exercising a pastoral superintendence over a district of the parish of Inishail, in the neighbourhood of that church and parish, and to which it was annexed quoad sacrc^ dur- ing the time of the Commonwealth. All the births, and marriages, and cases of discipline, that occurred in that district were insert^ ed in the register of Muckairn, as they are still, and its poor were admitted to a participation in the funds at the regular distribution, on the same footing with the poor of the parish. Antiquities. â€” Besides the castles already described, viz. Caol- churn and TraocheiUlein, there are several others in the parish. Achallader Castle is situate in the braes of the parish of Glen- urchy, and was built either by Sir Colin Campbell of the Castles, as he is designated, and Brst Laird of Glenurchy'of that name* or by his son, Black Sir Duncan of the Cowl. Sir Colin is said to have built no fewer than seven castles, viz. Taymouth, Pinlarig, Edinample, and Lochdoehard, in the county of Perth, and Caol- churn, Benculdine, and Achallader, in the county of Argyie. The exact period of its erection is not known. Its object is obvious, â€” that of preventing the raids and forays of the Lochaber clans. It served at the same time as a hunting-lodge, when the Noble owner chose to enjoy the pleasures of the chase in the ad- jacent forests of Bendourain, Corichbaa, and GlenceiUein. On the slope of a hill in the neighbourhood, several cairns, now partly overgrown with heath and moss, indicate the spot where a bloody conflict was fought, of which some tradition still survives. On a height overhanging the water of Teatle, on the farm of Duchoille, may be seen the ruins of an old fort or castle. Tra- dition does not indicate either the object or period of its erec- tion. It was built of dry stone, and resembles those old ruins so frequent in the Western Isles, which are called Danish forts; Another, apparently of the same description, stood on the farm of Barchasttallain, a little to the westward of the inn of Dalmally. A different origin, however, has been ascribed it. Digitized by Google GLENURCHY AND INTSHAIL. 97 No mean antiquary, the late Dr Donald Smith, claimed for this ruin a very remote antiquity. He considered it one of the resi*- dences or castles of the Fingalians. The tradition of the country agrees in ascribing the same antiquity to it. On the farm of Castles, stood another of these buildings, â€” to which circum- stance the name of the farm may be, with the most absolute cer- tainty, attributed. Not a vestige of it now remains. There are other localities in the parish which are called duns, on which it is alleged forts or castles stood, of old. One of these, Dun^ athadii stood on a height, commanding one of the best views of Loch Awe and Glenorchy, about two miles west of the inn of Dalmally, and where the traveller, journeying to Inverary, obtains the first view of that noble sheet of water. There are two places pointed out in Stronmilchain, where McGregor of Glenstrae had his residence. One of them stood on the slope of the hill above Tullich ; the other, which was built of wattles, and said to have been surrounded by a moat, and accessible only by a draw-bridge, was situate close to the White House in Stronmilchain. The only other ruin of this kind in the parish, of which we shall take notice, is one situate in an island in the Loch of Balimore, parish of Inishail. It was the refuge and sanctuary, in times of danger, of the proprietor, Baron M^Corquindale. It was of very paltry dimensions. There are neither crosses nor obelisks in either parish, with the exception of a large stone standing in a moss close by the Lorn Furnace Manager's house. The only religious house, so far as has been ascertained, that existed in former times in the pa* rish, was the nunnery of Inishail, the ruins of which are still dis- tinctly visible. The former Report says in reference to it, ** there is little on record, and tradition conveys but little information con- cemmg this house." It was a house of nuns, memorable for the sanctity of their lives and the purity of their manners. At the Reformation, when the innocent were involved equally with the guilty in the sufferings of the times, this house was suppressed and the temporalities granted ,to Hay, Abbot of Inchaffray, who^ abjuring his former tenets, embraced the cause of the Reformat' tioo. Separated from the mainland by a very narrow channel, a little to the eastward of the house of Rockhill, and forming part of that farm, lies asmall but well-wooded island, called the Priest's Isle, it is beautifully wooded, and in the centre embowered ii trees, and, surrounded by a dry stone wall of considerable thicks ARGYLE.

It is said to have been afterwards occupied for some time by the proprietor. It is a sweet secluded and romantic spot, 6t place for the exercise of meditation and prayer. A green spot near the top of Creaggan Chaorach, is pointed out as a place where once stood a chapel or oratory. No remains of it are to be seen. Tradition alleges, that a bold attempt was once made to throw a bridge across Lochawe, a little to the north of Cladich. On the south side of the lake, on the farm of Baran- dryan, huge blocks of stone may, fn a clear and calm day, be traced into the lake to a considerable distance, placed, it is said, at regu- lar distances. These stones and cairns, the foundation on which the intended bridge was to have rested, constitute the sole remains and monument of this formidable undertaking. These remains are called the Druid's bridge. A cairn of stones was opened, some years ago, on the farm of Stranmilchan, in which was found a stone coffin containing an urn. Modern Buildings, â€” The modern buildings in the parish of Glenurcby are the church and manse, the miln and kiln ; and in Inishail parish, the family mansions of Rockhill, Inishdrynieb, and New Inverawe. III. â€” Population. The census taken by Dr Webster in 1755, and by Dr M*Io- tyre forty years later, differ exceedingly little, if the former, like- the latter, excluded the district of Ichrachan from his census, there is only a difference of 60 between them. A great and rapid decrease has, however, taken place sinee. This decrease is mainly attributable to the introduction of sbeep^ and the absorption of small into large tenements. The abori- ginal population of the parish of Glenurchy (not of Inishail) has been nearly supplanted by adventurers from tlie neighbouring district of Breadalbane, who now occupy the far largest share of the parish. There are a few, and only a few shoots, from the fttetns that supplied the ancient population. Some clans, who were rather numerous and powerful, have disappeared altoge- ther ; others, viz. the Downies, M'Nabs, M'Nicols, and Fletchers, have nearly ceased to exist. The McGregors, at one time lords of the soil, have totally disappeared ; not one of the name is to be found among the population. The MMntyres, at one time ex- tremely numerous, are likewise greatly reduced. Digitized by Google GLBNUÂ»CHY AND INtSHAIL. 99 Gaelic is almost universally spoken ; the English is uftquestioo-^ ably gaining ground. The people are deeide.lly cleanly in their habits. Their cot* tages, although stiperior to those occupied by their forefathers, certainly are not, in most instances, favourable to habits of clean- liness. They are a people of a superior intellectual cast, â€” acute, shrewd, and intelligent They may also be considered a moral people. IV. â€” Industry. > It is believed that very few acres, in the parish, indeed, could be reclaimed with a profitable application of capital. Litfe-Siock. â€” Black-faced are the only sheep reared by our graxiers. A few Cheviots, Leicesters, and, in one instance, a smalt parcel of South Downs, may be seen in the policies of some of our proprietors. Every attention is paid to the cultivation or im* provement of sheep stock. The graziers are an intelligent class of men, and grudge no outlay in improving their stocks. The Argyleshire is the most common breed of cattle. There is only one fold of Ayrshire cows in the parish, although a few of tbem are to be seen in every direction. Highland cattle are found to pay better. Young cattle pay better than butter and cheese. The river Urcbay, which, by overflowing its banks when in flood, was wont to do a great deal of damage, is in course of being embanked for a space of two miles at least. This embankment, which is nearly finished, has done a great deal of good. The only place where irrigation is resorted to, is at Bunawe, and by the Lorn Furnace Company. This is not, in any proper sense of the lerm, an agricultural country ; and it is found that capital thus laid out gives but a poor return. The bed of the river Awe, where it flows out from the lake, was considerably lowered, and an im- mense mass of stones, the accumulation of centuries, was removed^ allowing the water to escape with greater rapidity. This drainage bat done a great deal of good in different places along both sides of the lake, but more especially to the low grounds along the banks of the Urcbay. The Urchay is in the course of being embanked almost exclusively at the Expense of the Noble proprietor, the te- nants, by whom it is executed, being allowed a certain rate of wages, when thus employed. Leases, for some years back, have seldom exceeded nine years' duration^ The superior class of tenants aregeneraily comforta- Digitized by Google 100 ARGYLESHIRB. bly lodged, their dwellings being, for the most part, built with stone and lime, and slated. Their offices, generally speaking, are of an infericf descriptioja, being for the most part built with dry stone, and thatched either with straw, fern, or rushes. There is a deficiency of enclosures. A great deal, however, in this way has been done of late throughout the parish, particular counte* nance being given to this species of improvement by the Noble proprietor of Glenurchy. Several important improvements have taken place in the parish since the former Statistical Report was drawn up. It was subsequent to that period, that the present church, manse, and schoolhouse, mill and kiln, were erected. Since then, the inn of Dalmally has been considerably enlarged. A very comfortable and respectably- kept inn has been built at Cladicb, and another on the south side of the ferry of Portsonachan. The whole of these places of enter- tainment are provided with excellent accommodations, and kept, it is believed, in a manner highly satisfactory to the public Our high roads, of which there are several lines, are maintained in aa excellent state of repair. Facilities for travelling have greatly mul- tiplied. Conveyances of every description, from the seated cart to the gay and dashing barouche, and post-horses are kept at all our inns, more especially at Dalmally. FisJieries. â€” Salmon and trout are the only fishings.

It is only of very recent origin, but its benefits are already felt V. â€” Parochial Economy. EcclesiasHeal State. â€” A better locality could not in aiiy respect have been chosen for the parish church of Glenurchy, than the spot on which it stands. It is in the centre of the population. This church was built in the year 161 1, after a design by James Digitized by Google J GLENUBCHY AND IMSIIAIL. 101 Elliot of Edinburgh, and executed by Allan Johnstone, architect of Taymouth Castle* It is exceedingly admired, and constitutes one of the most interesting features in a landscape, not surpassed in beauty and loveliness by any in the Highlands. It is kept in excel- lent repair. The church of Inishail is a paltry building, erected about seventy years ago. It is, all things considered, set down in as suitable a place as could have been selected, yet it is, notwithstand- ing, both distant and difficult of access to a large body of the pari* shioners. Lochawe, which intervenes, constitutes a serious obstacle to their attendance on public worship. Several benefactions, though small in amount, have been made at several periods to the parish of Glenurchy, none to the parish of Inishail. The largest of these was a sum of L. 100, bequeathed by Colin Campbell of Carwhin, great grand* uncle to the present Marquis of Breadalbane. The benefit is limited to the widows of tacksmen in reduced circumstances. This bequest, together with a sum of equal amount, made up of several small bene&ctions, left by several individuals, whose names are recorded in the session records, is placed in the hands of the Marquis of Breadalbane, for which he gives a handsome interest. The number of sittings in both churches inclusive, amounts to 750, (Glenurchy church 500, Inishail 250.) All the sittings are free. The manse was built in 1805. It underwent some repairs, and had some additions made to it about twelve years ago. Glebe, extent 22 acres, value L. 22. There is, besides, summer keep allowed for eight cows, being a servitude of two cows on each of four farms in the neighbourhood. An equivalent in pasture is given in one locality, in consequence of a private arrangement en- tered into with the proprietor. This enhances the value of the glebe L. 1 more. To the incumbent the value of both may be equal to about L. 40 a year. The stipend is twelve chalders meal, and L. 26 Sterling yearly teind. The teinds are all exhausted. There is what was a Chapel of Ease, until the Assembly Chapel Act was passed, giving the Chapels of Ease the status of quoad sa^ era parishes. It is one of the two places of worship in the quoad taera parish of Strathfillan. This chapel is situated in the braes of the parish. Public worship is celebrated here every third Sab- bath, the public ministrations of the clergymen being confined on the other two to the more populous district of Strathfillan. The two churches are placed six miles from each other. This parish, Digitized by Google 103 ARGYLE8H1RR. original a mission, was endowed by the good Lady Glenor* chy. The stipend is L. 60, including, it is beiie?ed, allowance for communion elements. Whilst the manse and manse of* (ices, and church of Strathfillan are upheld by the Society in Scoi^ land for Promoting Religious Knowledge, in whÂ«m the patronage is vested, the chm'ch at the bridge of Urcbay is upheld by the Marquis of Breadalbane, who has provided the minister with Â« good glebe and pasture for four or five milk eow^ and a horse and some sbeep. Education, â€” Number of schools, 6 ; parochial 3, endowed 6, op* held by Societies 2.

There is not a Latin scholar in Glenurchy school, where some twenty years ago there used to be a goodly number. The Glemirchy school ranked very high for a long period of time, for the amount of its attendance, and the success wiih which it was taught. It was resorted to from all the surrounding districts, and could boast of scholars from the south, and even the West Indies. It sent forth scholars who rose to distinction in several professions, â€” for instance the Smiths, of whom mention has already been made, and the late General Sir Alexander Campbell of Achallader, some time Governor of Madras. Ldteratiire. â€” There is one parochial library in Glenurchy pa- rish, containing from 200 to 300 volumes.

JAMES FERGUSON, MINISTER. I.^-TOPOGRAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. Prior to the year 16M, the parishes, now named as above, were annexed to the neighbouring parishes of Lochgoilhead and Invercbaolain, â€” Strachur to the former and Stralachlan to thelattec* Name* â€” The ancient name of Strachur was Kilmaglass^ sig- nifying the burying ground of Maglass, {Macffhlaisy) or Grey's son, who was the saint honoured with the religious devotions of the inha|i)itants of this locality. Stralachlan means the Strath of Lachlan, and derived its name, as is said, from that of tlie princi- pal heritor of that district, â€” Maclachlan, or Lachlan's son. The remains of a castle of some antiquity still exist. Stralachlan waa formerly called Kilmorrie, from Kil and Muire, the Virgin Mary. Extent^ jfc â€” The parish as such lies longitudinally from north- east and south-west Its length is 19 miles:, its breadth varies from 6 miles to about 3Â» Its boundaries on the east and north- east are the united parishes of Lochgoilhead and Kilmun ; on the south, those of Kilmun and Dunoon,, and the parish of Kilmodan ; on the west and north-west^ Loch fine. Digitized by Google 104 ARGVLESHIRBV Topographical Appearances. â€” The general aspect of ibe parish is highly, interesting. The hills are numerous, faatastieally m^et* ing and intersecting each other. The elevation of some of them above the level of the sea may be from 2000 to dOOO feet. With the exception of the Strath of Strachur and that of Stralacfalao, the arable land is inconsiderable ; the fotmer is the more exten- sive, and under pretty fair tillage* The Strachur hills are con* sidered first-rate pasture for sheep and black-cattle, and present a soft and rich verdure. Hydrography. â€” Lochfine bounds the parish on the north and ivest, embracing its whole length of nineteen miles, from north<*east to south-west Its depth is unequal, varying from thirty to eighty fathoms. Locheck is the only lake in the parish. It lies to the south by east from Lochfine, is six miles in length, and half a-mile in breadth ; it extends three miles within the limits of the parish. Its depth is very considerable, in some places equal to sixty and seventy fathoms. The river Hachaig, being the channel of com* munication between it and the Clyde at Kilmun, introduces into it some salmon and salmon-trout of good quality. The fresh water herring in it (an insipid kind of fish) are not found in any other lake on the .west coast, except in Loehlomond. The Cur is the only river deserving notice. It originates in the mountains bor- dering on Lochgoilhead, and extends miles in an irregular course. For a few miles, it flows with rapidity, in a south-western di- rection, until it arrives at the Strachur plains, when it flow^ smoothly on in a south by east direction. SdL â€” llie general character of the soils, is loamy, sandy, thin, and clayey. The Strachur Strath contains some hundred acres of good level land. It is supposed that some mines of coal and ore might be discovered, which would prove of great advantage to this district. Zoology. â€” The eagle pays occasional, visits, and some years ago one of that species carried off, killed, and devoured a child about three years old. Salmon and salmon-trout are found in Locheck, and some trout in the rivers. But the most important species, in an economical point of view, are the herrings found in Lochfine, generally ac- knowledged to be of superior quality. Botany. â€” The forests and plantations consist of oak, larclu a Digitized by Google 8TRACHUR AND STiiALACHLAN. 106 beecb, ashy hazel, alder, birch, 6r, elm, and mountain ash. Thb oak, fir, beech, ash, and hazel appear most congenial to the soil. II. â€” CiTiL History. Lond^owners. â€” The chief land-owners are, John Campbell, Esq. of Strachur ; and Robert M^Lachlan, Esq. of Stralachlan* Parochial Reffitten. â€” There are no parochial registers in exist* ence bearing date prior to the year 1758. Daring the succeeding twenty-eight years, they were not punctually attended to. Since then, however, they have been regularly kept Jntiquitiei. â€” Within the bounds of the parish, and towards that of Glendaruel, there is a stone remarkable for its locality, the emi* nence on which it is situated, commanding an extensive prospect. It is called Caillich-Vearor Vera, or the Old Wife of Thunder. Beir, being the Celtic word for thunder, and which, from cusÂ« tom or convenience, was transformed to Vera or Vear. Marvel* lous properties were ascribed by the superstitious inhabitants to this thundering lady ; it was said that she could, with ease and incre- dible agility, transfer herself firom one hill to another, command ter- rific thunder and desolating deluges at pleasure; and hence the dreadful apprehensions of incurring her ire that generally prevailed. A hill in Stralaohlan, rising in a curious conical shape, is seen at some distance, towering above the neighbouring ones. It is called Siene Sluagh^ the residence of the fairy people. Mannon Homes* â€” Several of these have been erected since last Statistical Account was published, viz. Glenshellis, Ballimore, Glenbrantir, Strachurmore houses, all built and finished with stone and lime, with slate and the best of timber. A good mill has also been built with the same materials. Strachur Park is presently occupied by I^ord Murray, whose benevolence and exemplary coo- duct, and that of Lady Murray, exert a beneficial influence around them* Their temporary residence here is no ordinary acquisition to the parish. IILâ€” Population* Amoimt of population in 1801. 1097 1811, . 1120 1821, 1204 1831, 1083 1841, . 1086 Gaelic is the language generally spoken ; but almost the whole of the rising generation speak English. IV. â€” Industry. Affricukurcm â€” The cultivated Is^id amounts to from lOOO to Digitized by Google 406 AttOTLESniRK. 1500 acres imperhrl : eonstantty waste or pasture lands, which have never been in cuUivatioO) to about 36,000. There may be from 1600 to 2000 acres under wood of all descriptions. The black-faced sheep and Highland cattle are the commoo breeds,^ and to their improvement much attention has of late been paid by the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, and by an Association of proprietors and formers connected with the Cowal district. There are several excellent farm-bnildings occupied by the laige tenants, such as pay from LÂ»100 to L.dOOof rent; yet all of that class are not comfortably lodged; but such as* pay from 1*50 to Li 100 are suitably accommodated. The houses of the crofters and cottars are, in many cases, very indifferent. David Napier, Esq. of Glenshellis, some years ago, built a house and offices, and planted and enclosed, to the extent of L.4000 at^ least. Considerable improvements have been made by Patrick For- bes, Esq. of St Cathrine's, where there is a comfortable inn, and many other conveniences for travellers. There is limestone in the parish, which is quarried, prepared, and sold at the rate of Is. 2d. per boll. The only 6shing systematically carried on is that of herring. Produce. â€” The average gross amount of raw produce raised in the parish may be as follows ;â€” Grain of aU kindmppropriAted todomwtie'Qcotioiiiy, . 14.1788 Potatoes, . . , . .

The church of Strachur was built in the year 1 789, and is in need of repair. It accommodates about 400 sitters. The late Miss Janet Campbell of Strachur left a legacy of L.20 Sterling to the poor of the parish of Strachur, about four years ago. The manse was built in the year 1779, and repaired different times since that period. Number of families attending, 107. Average amount of church collections during the year, L.12, 10s. The parish church in Stralachlan was built in the year 1792, and is undergoing repairs, which are not yet finished. The parish church accommodates about 150.

The stipend is the minimum, and a small sum is paid by the Exchequer to advance it to L.150 per annum. All the parishioners, with the exception of one Ra^ man Catholic family, belong to the Established Church, Divine service is generally well attended, and the communicants average about 260. Educatiofu â€” The number of schools in the parish is 3; paro^ cbial school, 1. The other two are side schools, and receive a part of the salary of the parochial one. The salary of the paro^ chial teacher is L.26, 10s., and the school. fees amount to L.14. The parochial teacher has the legal accommodation. - Number of schools in Stralachlan parish, three ; parochial schools, one.

A M'TAVISH, MINISTER. I.â€” ToPOORAPHY AND NaTURAL H18TORY. Name. â€” Inverchaolain is the ancient and modern name of this parish ; it is derived from the GaeliC) and signiBes ike plain er lands JU for tillage on the small stream^ which is descriptive enough of the situation of the manse and the adjoining farm. SituaHoUf Boundaries^ ffc. â€” This parish is situated in the dis- trict of Cowall, the south-eastern division of the county of Argyle. It is bounded on the south-east by the parish of Dunoon ; on ihe north and north-west, by the parishes of Kilmun and Olendaruel ; west and south-west, by Loch Riddan and the east Kyles of Bute. Its greatest length is about 15 miles, and greatest breadth 8 miles, including Loch Striven, which intersects it. Topographical Appearance and Clvnate. â€” The general surface of the parbh is hilly and rugged â€” a range of hills running along both sides of Loch Striven, but toward the south-eastern part, it becomes more level. The climate is, in general, very mild though moist. There is Digitized by Google 1NVERCHAOLAIN. 109 no disease that may be said to be peculiarly prevalent in the parbh. Typhus and other epidemics occur occasionally, brought from the low country, but are of short continuance. The snow rarely ever lies more than two days, on the low grounds near the shore* Wes* terly winds prevail, which bring frequent showers upon us from the Atlantic, but our heaviest rains are with southerly winds; and when the lofty hills of Arran are enveloped with clouds, we are sure to have a fall The people are generally healthy, and many live to a great age. The soil nearest the sea is generally light and sandy, with a mixture of moss in some parts, but there is a considerable variety, from its great extent : a large portion of it is of a very ted colour. Hydrography. â€” The parish is intersected by an arm of the sea called Loch Striven, signifying the loch of notes or pomU. It is upwards of nine miles long, and about two miles broad at the mouth, getting narrower as it enters the country. It varies in depth from 20 to 55 fitthoms in the centre, generally shelving gradually from the shore without any rocks or shoals ; in one or two parts the depth is so sudden that you might step on the land from a line of battle ship. There are several beautiful sandy beaches for bathing. The water is clear and very salt^ except when there are great floods of rain swelling the mountain torrents, which dis- charge themselves into it The luminous phosphoric appearance of the water at night is very marked, particularly during the autum* nal months, sometimes giving the loch the appearance of being on fire ; the waters of the East Kyles of Bute and Loch Riddan are much of the same character. There is in all, a sea shore of between thirty and forty miles. There is little current in Loch Striven, except what is occasion- ed by the rise and fall of the tide The tide is much more rapid in the Kyles of Bute, particulariy about the burnt islands near the entrance to Loch Riddan, and the flood tide coming from the firth of Clyde, (between Bogany point in Bute and To- ward Point in Cowall,) meets the flood tide coming in the West Kyles at a point about half-a mile west of South hall, and from this, point the ebb tide returns in the same way as it flowed. There is no stream in the parish deserving, the name of a river. It abounds in springs of the finest water. The only ones deserv<4 ing of notice are two diat discharge themselves from the opposite sides of a large hill about the same level, with a rushing noise, net ver seeming to vary. in. quantity, and not^ freezing. There are Digitized by Google no ARGYLKSHIRE. many beautiful small cascades, but the only one worthy of reÂ« mark is on a farm belonging to Archibald Campbell, Esq. of Glendaniel, where the water pours over a perpendicular rock with such force (when there is a flood in the stream) that it forms a beautiful arch, and the only way of getting from one side to the other of the stream when so flooded, is by going under the arch. Geology. â€” It principally consists of mica-slate and many hard rocks lying in beds. Several whinstone dikes appear in different parts of it, which can be traced in a direct line for a great distance, far beyond the bounds of the parish. Limestone has been wrought, but it is of a hard quality, and the purchasing of Irish lime in shell has been found less expensive. Zoology. â€” It is not remarkable for any rare animals. The laige greyhound fox has become very numerous of late years, and most destructive to the sheep stock. Ottars are frequently found along the sea-coast; badgers are now seldom seen; roe-deer are plentiful ; hares very numerous and of a large size, but the white or alpine hare are now seldom met with ; white and browawMvels are common ; wild-cats were numerous some years ago, but are not so now. Rats, mice, and moles abound ; but there are not many adders or lizards seen. All the common birds na* tural to this part of the country are found here ; crows are so much encouraged, that tliey are prodigiously destructive, parU* eularly to the newly sown flelds and iu the harvest time ; grouse are to be found on our mountains, and a few partridges iu our flelds ; the blackcock has become most plentiful of late years, and phea- sants are to be seen in all quarters since their introduction into the country by the late Kirkman Finlay, Esq. of Castletoward ; ptarmigan used to be found on two of our highest mountains, but were said to have been extirpated some years ago by the game* keeper of a neighbouring proprietor ; wood<*cocks, snipe, land and water*rails, green, golden, and grey plover are common io their season; herons are very numerous. In severe weather we are visited by wild geese, but they do not breed in the pariah ; swans are seen passing over us going south ; Iand*baniac)e some* times alight in our fields in the harvest season ; sea-ibwls of every kind are numerous on our waters, and a variety of divers, parti* eularly in the winter ; also, widgeon, teal, and other ducks. Loch Striven and the Kyles of Bute abound in fish of every kind common on the west coast. The most abundant are, the whiting, haddock, cod, ling, flounder, skate, mackerel, seath, or Digitized by Google INVfiRCHAOLAlN.

The most of them keep nets to embrace every favourable opportunity of catching them. The conger eel are numerous and of a large size, and though they are very troublesome to the herring-fishers, (from running along their nets and picking out the herrings,) yet they are fished in great quantities for the Liverpool market Shoals of grey mullet occasionally come into our loch, but few of them are caught ; sole are not abundant ; turbot and hallibut have sometimes been taken ; also that much prized fish, the John Doree ; the ink or cuttle-fish are to be found ; the ketfaick or ground-shark are often thrown on our shores by the storms ; the Portbeagle shark and dog-fish are common ; the porpoise or pelloch and whale follow the herrings ; seals are fre* quently seen ; lobsters, crabs, and shrimps are also prevalent ; there are a variety of shelUfish on our shores; oysters and muscles were at one time very plentiful, but are now scarce ; par and sal- mon-trout were abundant in our streams, but are yearly becoming less numerous. II.â€” Civil History. Heritors. â€” There are seven in the parish : John Campbell, Esq. of Southhall ; Alexander Lamont, Esq. of Knockdow ; Alex- ander Finlay, Esq. of Castletoward ; Sir John Fife of Gortan ; John Campbell, Esq. of Dunoon ; Archibald Campbell, Esq. of Glendaruel ; and Mrs Harkness of Garrachoren. ResidaU Heritors. â€” These are, John Campbell, Esq. of South- hall, whose place is beautifully situated neartheentrance to the East Kyles of Bute, commanding a prospect of the Firth of Clyde, as described in the former Statistical Account of this parish ; Alex- ander Lamont, Esq. of Knockdow ; and Sir John Fife, a gentleman from the north of JSngland, who has purchased property on both sides of Loch Striven within the last twenty years. He has built a most commodious cottage, delightfully situated on the east side of the loch, commanding a ^iew of Rothsay Bay, with Ayrshire and Arran in the distance^ He has planted nearly 100 acres about his place, and done much to ornament and improve the low grounds and hill-pasture. Also, Mrs Harkness, heretrix of Gar- rachoren. Antiquities. â€” The only thing particularly worthy of being noticed under this head, is the ruins of the old Castle of Ellandheirrig, on A Miall island in Loch Riddan, about a hundred yards from the main Digitized by Google 11*2 AKOYLB8HIRR* land, fortified by Archibald Earl of Argyle, when be nuuk biÂ» unfortunate descent upon Scotland in 1685. The castle was taken by his enemies and blown up ; but a small portion of it is still standing, and is seen from the steam-boats passing through the Kyles of Bute. This island and adjacent property at that time belonged to the ancient family of Ellandheirrig, who posses* sed a large estate in this part of the country, and were celebrated as warriors in Gaelic song. They are now extinct. The island DOW belongs to John Campbell, Esq. of Southhall, whose grand- oncle purchased it, along with what then remained of the property, from Sir Neil Campbell of Ellandhetrrig, the last of that house. There are tumuli in different parts of the parish. Several of them hare been opened. In some, stone coffins containing human bones were found ; in others, earthen urns with black ashes. Stone cof- fins containing human bones have been turned up in different parts of the parish. In digging the foundation of the present church in 1612, several dozens of human skulls were found, and near diem a few bones of a very large size. There is a large stone ten or twelve feet high in the middle of a field at the head of Loch Striven, but nothing is known about it III. â€” Population, &c. The return made to Dr Webster in 1755 was d44 ^ho^S^ Families.

It contains upwards of 40,000 iicrea, of which IdOO are arable, 1500 low pasture, 440 of thriving plantation of various ages, consisting principally of larch, Scotch spruce, and Digitized by Google INVKRCHAOLAIN. ^3 silver fir, oak^ ash, and birch. There are]|1000 acres of oa k cop- pice woods generally cut every twenty or twenty-one years^^ielding a handsome return to the proprietors. All the rest is hill pasture. The only remarkable trees are two hollies or great size, the largest near the mansion house of Southhall, the other|| near the^ farm- steading of Inverchaolain. Little advancement in agriculturei has* been made in the parish on the whole, and few improvements have taken place upon the lands of the old proprietors, except in the immediate neighbourhood of their own residences. There^is no regular rotation of cropping ; two or three, and even four*white crops are taken,UilPsometimes it hardly returns the seed sown, notwithstanding the^ forcing it with sea-weed ; thus the natural grasses are destroyed, and the land becomes covered with weeds, consequently many of the hill sides, once cultivated and left out in this state, have become overrun with heath* The lands in the immediate neighbourhood of the manse do not yield, by a third or even a half, what they are said to have done fifty years ago. There are no proper ring fences, not even the old ones kept up which separate the hill pasture from the home farm or arable land. The parish principally consists of sheep farms, containing a portion of arable land, and generally let for a period of nine years, (many of them rack-rented,) which is considered too short. However, Mr Finlay has a few arable farms in the pa- rish highly cultivated, drained, and subdivided, though the lands are principally very sandy and light, a great portion of them be- ing reclaimed from barren heath, by the late Archibald Younger, Esq. a former proprietor. The leases on these lands extend to nineteen years, and the farmers have comfortable houses. Live-StoeL â€” There are about 10,800 sheep in the parish, all of them of the black-faced breed, with the exception of nearly 100 Leicester, fed on the low grounds by two of the proprietors, and a few pets. About 150 slack ewes are wintered on the low pas- ture, and sold, with their lambs, to the butchers in summer. There are some very good sheep-stocks, and well attended to in every respeet. The hill pasture is generally good, and surface-draining in some instances practised : but, upon the whole, we do not consi- der the sheep-stocks improving of late years. There are upwards of 250 cows, 7 bulls, and 240 young cattle fed during the summer months, and nearly 200 calves reared annually. They are princi- AROTLE^ H Digitized by Google 114 ARGTLESHIRK. j^ally of the Argyleshire breed. There are about 40 of the Ayr- shire short-horned breed kept for their milk. There are 71 horses in the parish, principally a cross between the Highland and Clydesdale. The sheep are readily sold to the Greenock, Glas- gow, Rothesay, or Dunoon fleshers at fair prices. Young cattle are purchased by drovers for the different low country markets. V. â€” Parochial EcoNOBiir* There is no village in the parish. Means of Communication. â€” There are about thirty miles of made road. The scenery is bold and romantic: from the mansioii- house of Southhall to the head of Loch Riddan it is truly beauti- ful. It is considered to surpass the celebrated entrance to the Trossachs at the foot of Loch Caterine* The road from South Hall to Glendaruel is kept in the best order. I cannot say much in commendation of the way in woich the other roads in the pa- rish are attended to. They are chiefly made and repaired by statute labour. Ecclesiastical State. â€” There are two places of worship, the pa- rish church and a chapel built by subscription, and a contribution from the General Assembly's Church Extension fund. The lat- ter was opened for public worship by the parish minister on the 23d of August 1 840. The parish church is situated on a rising ground immediately behind the manse, surrounded by a beautiful burying-ground. It was built in 1812, and might be made very comfortable if it was strapped and lathed and properly attended to, and is the third church on the same site. The 6rst was built by a man who said that he dreamt that he would find a treasure concealed in a certain spot in the parish, (which is still pointed out,) and was commanded to build a church with it on ** Croch* dan in airy," but his funds became exhausted, and a part of it remained unslated for many years. There was another church built close to this old one in 1745, which was pulled down when the late Mr Campbell of Southhall, the principal heritor, iaaist- ed on building the present church, to the great annoyance of some of the other heritors. The old Roman Catholic place of worship and burying*ground were situated on an eminence about 2(M) yanb above the present one, on the side of tlie hill. The chapel is most comfortable in every way, and situated on the east Kyles of Bute. The manse was built in 1807 by order of the Court of Session, but the then incumbent accepted of one inferior to Digitized by Google INVBRCHAOLAIN.

The office houses are pretty good, the principal line of them being roofed, and several of them entirely built at the minister's own expense. The glebe consists of about four acres of arable, and three roods of pasture and unimprovable ground. Several encroach- ments are said to have been made upon it during vacancies ; be- sides, there is a servitude of eight cows upon the surrounding church lands of Strondharaig ; but, from the overstocked and wretched system of cropping the land, the servitude is of little va^ lue. There is no doubt but the minister was entitled to followers to those C4>W8, according to the original universal custom of the country ; and the minister was always, even of late years, in the habit of keeping one or two calves, till, about three years ago, they were driven off by the present proprietor of the lands. The stipend, decreeted for in 1775, is 100 bolk 3 firlote of oat- meal, and 158 Scots money of vicarage. What this is short of L.150 Sterling, is made up by Her Majesty's Exchequer. There are lands in the parish rented at upwards of L.200 per annum unvalued. There is little vacant teind. The valued rent of the parish is L.204, 8s. 5d. Sterling: the real rental is L.34i00, 15s. Sterling, exclusive of the lands in pos- session of the resident heritors, and the returns for woods and plantations. Education. â€” There are only two schools in the parish. The schoolmaster's accommodation is miserable, and the schoolmaster, who died a few months ago, was in poverty, although a most meri- torious man. There was a good school-house built a few years ago for the side school, which is inefficiently tAught, the teacher being oldÂ« I had a small school taught at the head of Loch Striven for some seasons, which did much good. There are two Sunday schools kept in the parish that are superintended by the minister. Poor and Parochial Funds. â€” The average number of persons Digitized by Google 116 ARGYLESHIKE. OD the roll is from twelve to thirteen, besides others who receive occasional assistance. There still remains a capital of L. 60 Sterling, saved many years ago from the collections at the church door; a legacy of L.100 Sterling, received two years ago; col' lections at church door, about L. 20 per annum. The heritors have been prevailed upon, of late years, to assess themselves from L. 12, 17s. to L. 13^ 178. per annum; and from these sources, and receiving occasional small donations and legacies, we have hitherto supplied the necessities of the poor, giving them from L.2 to L.8 per year, according to their necessities, so that there is not a beggar in the parish. The people in general are very kind to the poor, and there has not been, for a great many years, any who went beyond the bounds of the parish to seek alms, except two who were weak in the mind, and could not be prevented from wandering. There is generally a great aversion on the part of the poor to seek parochial aid. Friendly Society. â€” There is a Friendly Society whicb has exist- ed for upwards of half a century, and does much good. FairSi jfc.-^ There is but one fair held in the parish. There are four public-houses. Fuel â€” Coals are principally used, and cost from ISs. to 158. per ton, conveyed by water ; peats are also used, but it iÂ» difficult to procure them. July 1843. Digitized by Google PARISH OF ARDNAMURCHAN.* PRESBYTBRY OF MULL, SYNOD OF ARGYLE. THE REV. ARCHIBALD CLERK, MINISTER. L â€” Topography and Natural History. Names. â€” Before the ReformatioD, three parishes were com- prised in the portion of country now known as the parish of Ard- nainurchan. At the establishment of the Protestant Church, these appear to have fallen under the care of one minister ; but the united parishes, according to a practice not unfrequent, re- ceived as a common name, not that of all or any of the three pa- rishes, but that of the chief of five districts within its bounds. This was Ardnamurchan, naturally the most fertile, and conse- quently, before the resources of the less arable, though now per- haps not less valuable districts, were discovered, by far the most populous, â€” a precedence which it still holds to a considerable eit- tenU Some consequence farther accrued to it from the castle and residence of the ancient Lords of Ardnamurchan and Sunart be- ing situated at its western extremity, as are also, since the Re- formation, the parish church and dwelling of the minister. The ancient and perhaps poetical name of Ardnamurchan was ** Riochd na Sorcha," (the kingdom ofSorcha^) an appellation for certain districts not singular in the Highlands, and. which would claim for it in remote antiquity certainly not less extent than in modern times it possesses as a parish. Its present name is un- derstood to signify the " Promontory or heights of the great seas^** (Aird nam Mor Chuan,) though some may fancy it to be " Aird nam Mur Chumhan," the ** promontory of the narrow seas** Certainly both are strictly significant of its character and position, for to the westward it throws a bold and striking headland of ste- rile rock far into the sea, so as to form a remarkable boundary be- â€¢ Drawn up by the Rev.

The measurement of the former is 87,753 acres Scotch, that of the latter the irriter has in vain tried to procure. It is in all probability a good deal more than that of the Ai^yleshire portion of the parish. The ex* tent of the whole is estimated in the last Statistical Account at 200,000 acres, a moderate computation. Boundaries. â€” The parish is bounded on the south -west by the northern end of the Sound of Mull ; on the south, by Loch Su- nart, which winds eastward betwixt it and Morren. At the upper end of this loch, both parishes are conterminous for a mile or so. On the east, it is bounded by the district of Kingerloch, in the parish of Lismore ; on the east and north*east, by those of ArdÂ« gower, Lochiet, and Locharkaig, in the parish of Kilmalie, tbe boundary line passing, it is said in the old Statistical Account, ** over a range of ten mountains, by as many alternate ascents and descents ;" certainly over a country rugged and mountainous in the extreme. On the north, it is bounded by Lochmorir and the river issuing from it, which divide it from Northmorir, in the pa- rish of Glenelg ; and on the north-west and west, by that part of the Atlantic which washes the opposite shores of Skye and the Small Isles. Topography. â€” It is difficult to take a connected view, or to com- municate a general idea, of a parish of such vast extent and di- versified conformation. It may, however be described as a broad stretch of rugged mainland, branching into the sea in several points and promontories, the most 'southern of which the noted headland of Ardnamurchan, is by far the most prominent. In attempting a particular description, it may assist imagination to follow the immemorial division into districts, which appears to have been determind at some remote period, according to great natural landmarks. The peninsula or district of Ardnamurchan, properly so called, consists of a range of rather low hills, running from the well-known point in an easterly direction to the distance of about twenty-four miles, nowhere less than four and a-hal^ nof exceeding seven miles in breadth. For ten or twelve miles from the point, the hills are of the secondary or transition series, and in some places afford pasture of the finest quality. A large portioUf Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. UD comparatively, of the coast, coDsists of productive arable and seÂ» veral well-cultivated farms, while little wood is to be seen. Be- yond this, the country assumes the bolder and more precipitous aspect of the gneiss or mica slate formation ; the pastures become coarser ; woods of oak, birch, and hazel, especially on the south, through which scanty patches of cultivated land are seen at distant intervals, clothe the nakedness of the rocks, and cover the lower part of the hills down to the waters of Loch Sunart. At its junc- tion with Sunart, Ardnamurchan slopes gradually on the south into a low neck of land, across which the line of demarcation ex- tends for three miles, from the beautiful Creek of Salen on Loch Sunart to the west end of LochshieL On the north, its eastern extremity is a moss flat of great extent, upon which the hills abruptly descend, and which is bounded by the river Sbiel, the boundary betwixt this district and Moidart. Sunart. â€” In some old records, it is written Swynefort or Swynr- ford. Hard by its western extremity, but in Ardnamurchan, there is a creek where boats or galleys might be drawn up or moored, called Swinefort, which in Gaelic means the port or landing-place of Swin, Swen, or Sweno; in the tenth century, a king of Denmark, an apostate from Christianity, having been driven from his king- dom took refuge in Scotland, where, during his exile, he again em- braced the true faith. If this Prince landed at Swinefort, or re- sided in the district, both may have been named from that circum- stance. At any rate ** Suain Mac High Lochlunn," ^* Swin Prince of Denmark," is a name well known ia Highland tradition, and it appears certain that Sunart is compounded of ^* Suain" and ^* Aird, height or eminences." Suaine, however, also, in Gaelic, means rest or sleep. The exceeding stillness of the land-locked waters of Loch Sunart may have suggested the name given to secure and tranquil Suain and also to the district This dis- trict is a continuation of Ardnamurchan, and is in mean breadth not less than 10, nor in length than 25 miles. The character of its rocks and soil is the same with that of the contiguous poition of the latter ; but its mountains rise to a greater height ; its valleys are wider and deeper ; its scenery altogether cast in a grander mould ; and its declivities more amply wooded. For a few miles, it presents the aspect of one mountainous ridge, which, as we pro- ceed eastward, expands. The coast on the south trends to the south-east, and on the north for a much greater distance to the north-east, so as to give a far greater breadth at its eastern than Digitized by Google 120 AR6TLBSHIRE. western extremity; and while an unbroken range of high idood* tains may be traced overlooking Loch Suoart on the one hand* and Lochshiel on the other, the intermediate country, especially as we approach the boundary^ consists of an irregitlar assemblage of huge hills, circular valleys and glens. Moidartf pronounced in Gaelic Muidard, ('* Mud," an old Gaelic word for sea spray, and *' Aird," heights, literally the heights of sea spray, a most descriptive designation,) about 25 miles long, with a breadth all along probably of 10 or 12. It lies parallel to Sunart along the whole extent of Lochshiel, and to Ardnamur- chan, for a few miles west from that lake, jutting out in several bold and craggy headlands in that direction into the ocean. Washed on the west and north by the sea, and on the south by Lochshiel, and the river which constitutes the western outlet of that lake, it is, like Ardnamurchan and Sunart, bounded on all sides by water except on the eastern end, which rests partly on Arasaig and the parish of Kilmalie. Both sides present a nearly unbroken chain of mountains, but the space between baffles description, consist* ing of '* Crags, rocks, and hills confuiedly hurl'd, The fragments of some former world.** These, all resting on a high mountain range, are covered with scanty grass and heath, the uniform brown of which bleak pastur- age is varied only by the gray and often precipitous rocks, the shadows of some dark ravines, and the grayish -green of hollows where the accumulated washings of the rocky masses form a deeper and less barren soil. There are, however, valuable plains and valleys in this interesting district, which shall yet be noticed. Arasaig and South Morir. â€” Aras^ place or dwelling-place; aiffj a harbour or bay, the place of the harbour ; tnarir^ mor^ ^^^ > and thir^ pronounced Air, land, the great or mainland. The first is descriptive of the best known and most fertile part of Ara- saig ; the second would naturally have been conferred on the dis- trict by the islanders, being, as it still is, a common resort for island craft. These districts being divided by no well-defined natural demar- cation, may be described as one. They constitute together a por- tion of country twenty-four miles long by fifteen broad, the west- ern parts of which, like those of Moidart, project seaward, in seve* ral rocky points and headlands. The hills on the sea coast are generally rather low, though rugged and sterile.

This, which lies northward of all the other districts of the parish, exceeds all in the wild and savage grandeur of its scenery. It, however, con- tains some extensive and good sheep pastures, and some green fields and cultivated land on the coast, which delight the eye, as well as woods, chiefly of birch, which give beauty and shelter to the shores of Loch Morir and Lochoranua. Hydrography, â€” Loch Sunart, an arm of the 8ea> about twenty- five miles long, bounding the parish on the south, is an offset of the Sound of Mull, at its junction with which it is about six miles in breadth, and becomes gradually narrower until, six or seven miles inland, it appears to terminate at the group of islands formed by Carna, Risga, and Oransay. Between these, the tide rushes with great velocity into a land-locked and generally smooth ex- panse, constituting the greatest portion of the length of the loch, varying from half a mile to two miles in breadth, and much from the straight line, in consequence of the points of Dungallan in Ardnamurchan and Airderinish in Morvern projecting in opposite directions. The water here has generally the brown colour of the many mountain streams which flow into it^ and has all the ap- pearance of a fresh water lake enclosed by high and rocky moun- tains, abrupt rocks, and wooded promontories, without any visible traces of the parent sea except the ebb and flow of the tide, the sea- v^eed laid bare at low- water, and an occasional porpoise or smaller fishes pursuing their prey. At about six miles from its head, it again contracts into a narrow strait of no great length, and again expands, retaining a breadth varying from a quarter to half a mile until it terminates. There is a very correct chart of this arm of the sea, in the possession of Sir James Miles Riddell, Bart. Loch Moidart runs into the district of that name for about four miles from west to east Its depth does not appear to be great ; and great part of its bottom is laid bare at low water. The sea enters by narrow channels on each side of the island Shana in its mouth.

It is about four miles in mean breadth, for about the same distance of its length, untiU at the headland of Ardnish, it becomes narrower, and terminates, three or four miles farther on, in a small bay beyond Barradale. Loch- atnart, five or six miles long, generally less than a quarter of a mile broad, winds betwixt Ardnish and Moidart, and terminates at Kin* chr^an in Arasaig. It is a branch of Loch*nan-Uamb. The course of both is from west to east Loch-na-Reaull, immediately north of the point of Arasaig, is in length about three miles or upwards, being from north-west to south-east : it is a shallow expanse of about one and aÂ«half or two miles in breadth. Loch ShieL â€” Of the inland lakes, which abound in all parts of the parish, this is, in every respect, the most important It fills the lower part of the entire valley which divides Sunart and Moi- dart, is computed at twenty-five to twenty-seven miles in length, varies from 200 yards to three-quarters of a mile in breadth, but in the greater part from a quarter to half a-mile. At its west end, it is shallower, and reposes on a bed of fine sand (as do the great moss flats contiguous,) similar to that of the sea-shore, about two miles distant About six miles to the eastward, it becomes deep, and, from the character of the country, retains, it is probable^ great depth on to its eastern end* Its water has the usual dark- brown colour of lakes similarly situated, but is clear and pellucid in a glass vessel, pure and pleasant to the taste. Its elevation above the sea cannot be great, for the river by which it flows into the Western Ocean is navigable, except during great drought, for open boats. From its eastern end, it discharges its waters, in con- siderable volume, by a stream a few miles long, through the parish of Kihnalie into Locheil, a branch of the Linne Hiloch. 3 Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. 123 The circumstance of this lake almost coDnectiog the arm of the sea into which the Caledonian Canal opens to the west with the western ocean, by a short and direct line, (whereby the long and nearly circular route through the Linne Hiloch, the Sound of Mull, and round the formidable point of Ardnamuchan, would be saved,) attracted the notice of Mr Telford, and is noticed in his report regarding the Caledonian CanaL The opening of this line of communication ou the same scale would evidently greatly increase the benefit of that canal. Even the deepening of the river Shiel, and a canal, however unezpensive, connecting the lake with the sea on the east, would prove, not only locally, but generally use- ful. Open boats from tho. Western Isles are in the practice of entering the lake by the river, and taking away ladings of the tim- ber on its banks. Fishermen from the east have pulled their boats overland from Lochshiel into the lake, and, finding their way on its waters into the western sea, have taken a fiiU cargo of fish before companions, who took the more circuitous route, arrived at the fishing-station. The scenery of this lake at its west end is, for several miles, rather sombre, consisting chiefly of brown low hills, flats of brown moss, through which the lake winds itself. The ever-green island of St Finnan, about six miles eastward, ap- pears an oasis in the desert Beyond this, the lake plunges into the midst of high mountains, whose sides, generally nearly precipitous, are streaked with the foam of falling streams, or seamed with rugged ravines. Woods of oak, ash, and birch, thrive vigorously among the cliffs and promontories. The hills are occasionally green, rounded, and swelling, for many miles, but their prevailing character is stern and grand ; the visitor feels a sense of loneliness, seldom broken by the sight of a human habitation, or enlivened by any sound but the dash of waterfalls or the scream of some bird of prey. Loch Morir extends from west to east Its wide expanse of water lies betwixt South Morir, in the parish of Ardnamurchan, and North Morir, in that of Glenelg, for a length exceeding twenty miles, and with a breadth varying from one to probably three mil^s. Its depth is unknown, but is probably considerable. Its elevation is considerably above that of Lochshiel ; its colour much the same. Like Lochshiel, it fills the lower part of an extensive valley, bounded by high and steep hills, but without any great flats on its shores. Some arable grounds on the gentler slopes are seen at a distance, and woods thriving vigorously at frequent Digitized by Google 124 AnoVLESHinK. intervals ; and though the mountains present the bleak and speck- led aspect of patches of rock and heather contending for the mas- tery, their huge bulk saves them from the charge of tameness, and some excellent sheep grazing from that of utter barrenness. The scenery of the west end is well-wooded and interesting, and from thence the lake lies open to et^stward for about fifteen miles, a wild, dreary, yet magnificent prospect. Loch Beoraig, situated east of the arable part of Meoble, in the glen of that name, is from two to three miles long. Loch Eilt, about the same length, is the largest of a chain of small lakes in the great glen, which extends from Locbainart towards Glenfinnan. There is also a lake of considerable size in the valley of Glenhui- ricb in Sunart. Of lakes of all sizes there are said, in the old Statistical Account, to be 300 in the parish, the correctness of which statement there is no reason to doubt. Rivers. â€” Of these the most important, in every respect, are those flowing from Loch Shiel and Loch Morir. That from the east end of the former flows into the parish of Kilmalie ; that from the west end, about two miles long, having the broadest channel, and probably the greatest volume of water, flows into the Western â€¢Ocean, into which Lochmorir also pours its waters in a fine stream, apparently of much the same volume and length. I'he river Mioble, flowing into Morir, and of Pollock, flowing into Loch Shiel, are also considerable streams. Mountains. â€” The only hills of which, so far as the writer could ascertain, the altitude has been taken, are those in Sunart, men- tioned in the last Statistical Account, viz. Ben Husepol, 2661 feet; Scur Dhoniel, 2730 feet; Scour Choinich, 2364; Creach bhunn, 2439; Glaschoiren hill, 1920. The mountain ranges, of which it may be remarked, that they generally, if not al- ways, run in an eastern direction from the sea coast, require a more particular examination and a more scientific description than it was in the writer's power to bestow. Valleys. â€” Near the eastern extremity of Sunart, the beautiful and fertile valley of Strontian opens to the south, upon the arm of the sea which bears the name of that district, and retires inland for about five or six miles; first, in a westerly and then in a northerly direction, where, on one side, it is covered with some fine natural oaks. At its opening, the prominent objects are the flourishing plan- tations, the tasteful grounds and picturesque residence of the proÂ« prietor, and so far forward, as to be situated on the shores of Loch Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. 125 Sunart, a neat and comfortable inn. Farther back, on the same or east side of the yalley, are seen the well*managed farm and ex- cellent farm-house and offices of Drimantarran, an extensive flat of improYed and productive moss ; and, on the other, far up the lower slopes of the hills, to the upper extremity of the glen, the dwellings and welUcultivated crofts of numerous cottagers. Close by the quiet stream which divides the valley, and tolerably centri- cally situated, stands the Government church, and at some dis* tance northward, overlooking the place of worship, and the most populous part of the glen, on a sheltered yet elevated situation, the low-roofed manse of the minister. The level part, which is not many yards above the level of the sea, is nowhere above a few hundred yards broad ; but the tops of the bounding hills are seve- ral miles distant, so that they do not overhang but shelter the vaU ley, which is consequently warm, sunny, and cheerful. Opening in the opposite direction upon Loch Shiel, immediately on the other side of a high mountain range, and little, if at all, above the same level, is another valley of some miles extent from north to south. The hill sides are here precipitous, and overshadow the strath below, and there is a wild and sombre grandeur in the sce- nery, well and beautifully relieved by some acres of level and good land, and the neat little arable enclosures and farm-house of Pol- lock, situated where the hills, whose cliffs are there adorned with partial coverings of birch, expand, and receive into their bosom a magnificent bay of Loch Shiel. Glenaheurich is a valley in Sunart of some note, containing a lake of considerable size, a good farm-house, and remarkably fine sheep pasture. It is situated a few miles north of Slrontian. To the same district also pertain about two miles of the great glen, which runs from the bead of Loch Sunart to the shores of the Linne Hiloch, and which connects the peninsula composed of Morven and Kingerloch with the mainland. Gfeiui/actafe.â€” About six or seven miles east of Pollock, a val- ley of this name in Moidart opens to the south upon Loch Shiel, the flat or strath being about 300 yards broad, but little above the level of the lake, and consisting of some tolerable arable and im- provable pasture. The hills which confine it are towards Loch Shiel, green, rounded, and swelling. It is about two miles long, running from south to north. Kifdochmoidart. â€” At the head of Lochmoidart, which indents the western extremity of this district^ the high bounding ranges Digitized by Google 126 ARGYLESHIRR. which inclose the lake continue to run tDtand, and form the first part or opening of a valley, about seyen or eight miles long. The level land here is about 200 acres in extent, (the soil moss about two feet thick on a bed of clay,) extending about three-quar* ters of a mile along the head of the loch, and about the same dis- tance back into the glen, with a quarter of a mile in mean breadth* It is all good and productive arable, though still capable of much improvement, to which the greatest obstacle is its slight elevation above the level of the sea. Some fine old sycamores and other trees around the embowered and sequestered residence of the proprietor, attest the maturity and great size to which forest trees are there capable of arriving. Groves of vigorous larches and firs, and woods of oak, birch, and ash, profitably adorn the lesser eminences and the slopes of the high mountains. Where the plain of Kinlochmoidart terminates on the east, the valley takes a north-easterly direction, and we come upon the farm of Locbans, and a small lake not more probably than ten or fifteen feet above the level of the sea, the flat land being about 150 yards broad, chiefly swampy, yet improvable ground. After this, the valley, under the name of Glenforslan, contracts, until, at about a mile from its upper extremity, beyond a farm-house of that name, the level ground ceases, and the stream fills the entire bottom. This last is not the least valuable part of the glen. The hills, though steep, are covered with a depth of soil uncommon in such situa- tions, and of course with grass of superior quality. Gibsti^.â€” About six miles from Kinlochmoidart, a valley of this name runs for about two miles from Lochnanua to the south, requiring no particular description. Glenmeuble, â€” This is a long deep and dreary valley, aitfiated in the wildest and central parts of Arasaig, extending from Lock- morir on the north-west, towards Glenfinnan on the south-east, for at least ten miles. The only habitable portion is the fiirm of Meoble, situated at its north-eastern extremity, where there are some acres of tolerable arable and considerable plain. South-east from this, its lower part is for three miles occupied by the waters of Loch Brosaig, a lake about a quarter of a. mile broad, beyond which the windings of the glen are soon lost in the misty recesses of precipitous and overhanging hills. It would be interminable and bootless labour even te allude to all the valleys in a parish of such vast extent, consistiog, as it does, almost altogether of hill and glen ; but one more may be men- Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. 127 tioned, as connected with the general structure of the country. It extends from GlenBnnan, at the east end of Lochshiel, in a north-eastern direction for some niiles> when it is intercepted by a mound, or lower mountainous range, connecting the higher ranges on each side. Beyond this, the valley meets with no si- milar interruption, until it terminates at the head of Lochaylort, distant ten miles from Glenfinnan. This is the neck which joins the whole of Moidard and part of Arasaig to the mainland. Mot8 Flats* â€” At the west end of Lochshiel, and in close neighbourhood, there are three extensive flats of this description. The Moss of Kinkaw, extending from the west end of that lake to the sea shore, and along the eastern bank of the river Shiel, is, according to an old survey of Sir Alexander Murray of Stanhope, fully seven square miles in area. Another, the moss of Acbaneilein, with a mean breadth apparently of about three- fourths of a mile, stretches along the south side of Lochshiel for opwards of five miles from near the eastern boundary of the first. The greater part of both is a perfect quagmire, or quaking moss of unknown depth, through which progress can only be made by leaping from one tuft of stunted heather and coarse grass to ano- ther ; but many hundred acres of both, especially along the max* gin of the lake and the sea shore, are highly improvable ; the moss, onl} two or three feet deep, reposing upon a bed of sandÂ« Right opposite to the Moss of Achaneilein, on the north or Moi- Azxi side of Lochshiel, is situated the Moss of Langal, a plain of 679 acres, all capable, at a moderate expense, of being converted into highly productive arable soil. The moss rarely exceeds three or four feet in depth ; the substratum is sand, which^ when brought to the surface in trenching, soon decomposes the peat With the help of a marly shell sand, found in considerable quantities in the bed of the river Shiel, at the western end of this moss, and some Boa ware, good crops of potatoes have been raised, although the ground was not broke up until the previous winter. On the hill elopes to the eastward, there are 400 acres of the same deserip- tion, equally susceptible of improvement At Inveraylort, in Arasaig, there is a considerable iat of im:- provable moss, not unlike that of Langal in quality, but not pro- bably exceeding fifty acres in extent Betwixt the west end of Lochmorir and sea shore of Arasaig, there is another great moss flat of many hundred acres, a great proportion of which, it may be presumed, from the success with Digitized by Google 19A AUGYLESHIRB. which a few patches have been cultivated, is improvable, and may yet, with the other great mosses of the parish, should the resources of the Highlands come into notice, attract a small share of the enterprize and capital so lavishly expended on distant colonies and foreign lands. The moss last mentioned, it will be noticed, is situated similarly to that of Kintra, in so far as to lie betwixt a great lake and the sea, but with this difference, that it is sepa* rated from both by low hills. There are many other mosses of considerable size in the parish. Caves. â€” On the north coast of Ardnamurchan there are several qaves, which are sometimes thought worthy of a visit ; as also, on the shores of Lochnanua, '^ the Loch of Caves," in Arasaig. Three of these the writer has entered. One about 300 feet long or upwards, enters on the land side of a precipitous mass of rock, on the farm of Giendrian, in Ardnamurchan, and so nearly ap- proaches the sea on the other, that the rise and fall of the waves, as they tumble and boil without, is heard distinctly at its inner extremity, which is coated with spar. It is generally extremely narrow ; the sides, which rise to a great height, are far inclined from the perpendicular, and correspond with the dip of the mica slate rocks, out of which it seems cleft. Another, not far to the eastward, much of the same description, terminates in a small chamber about ten feet high, and about ten feet by four in length and breadth, coated with white spar slightly tinged with brown. The numerous projections on the sides and root are translucent, and appear, when lighted, somewhat of an amber colour. The sea enters at high water, and access is diflScult. On its 6r8t dis- covery, not a great many years ago by some boys in pursuit of goats, many stalactites, thick as a man's arm, and several feet long, hung like icicles from its roof and sides. Unfortunately, the exciseman of the district happened to be a man of taste, and, impelled by that love so common to tourists, of appropriating objects, the value of which, any where else but where they are found, it is difficult to discover. Accordingly, he broke and took away all the stalactites. Another cave, in Suerdale Charrach, also on the north shores of the same district, nowise remarkable in itself, was, in past times* visited by sick people for the recovery of health. A shallow cavity, in the interior, contains about a quart of water, which, though completely removed, soon forms again in a manner supposed to be miraculous, by oozing through the moist rock. Of this the visitor drank, and leftÂ» as an offering. Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. 129 a smalt piece of ifioDey, or any article of little value. A few years ago, some pins, needles, metal buttons, and an old halfpenny^ might be seen there, the last tribute to expiring superstition. At Baradale, in Arasaig, a cave is shown as one of those rude fast* nesses which gave shelter to Prbce Charles Stuart after his de- feat at Culloden, a purpose for which it is well adapted. It is in a rock of mica slate, and within expands into an apartment of considerable size, floored with jagged and uneven stones. Yet here, in damp and utter darkrless, the unfortunate Prince took reÂ« foge for three- days. There is another cave, on Locbnanua, not now well known, where he also concealed himself. Another, in Ocal, in Ardnamurchan, is said, on its own account, to be well wnrtb a visit Of course, in a parish of such extent, there are many clefts and fissures running into the rocks, which it would be tedious to mention. All are on the sea shores, and many the haunts of wild pigeons. CoasL^^The coast, the extent of which, considering how deeply and frequently the land is indented by lochs, cannot be estimated at less than several hundred miles, is, so far as can be seen fr9m shipboard, generally bold and rocky, especially the headland of Ardnamurchan, which, from its position, is thrown much in the course of mariners. When the wind is high, and blows from the open sea, as it generally does on one part or other of this iron- bound promontory, its aspect is very formidable. The sea rises with the abrupt and irregular motion occasioned by strong tides, so very dangerous to open boats ; breaks in huge masses of boil- ing foam and showers of spray against the rugged barrier of na- ked rock, while no creek or landing-place, where even life could be saved, though there are in fact several, is visible. North of the point of Ardnamurchan, the coast inclines sud- denly inward and eastward, so as to form, with the point of Ara- saig bearing east north-east from the former, a deep and wide bay, the shores of which, presenting all around a seaward frontier of rock^ high ranges, and rocky headlands, seem everywhere in- accessible. At the point of Arasaig, where the land again juts considerably to the westward, the coast, though rocky, is compa- rativei]i low. Here, however, ledges of low and numberless sunk rocks extend to the northern boundary of the parish, guarding the mouth of Lochoakeaull and the sandy shores of Lochmorir, with a barrier line of breakers advanced about three-quarters of a mile inin the sea. ABGYLt:. I Digitized by Google ^^^ AR0YLE8HIRE. Headlands and Islands. â€” The headland of Ardoamurchan is not only the most noted in the parish, but on the whole line of coast betwixt Cape Wrathand the Mull of Cantire, being the westernmost part of the mainland of Britain. From the era of Somerled to the reign of James VI^ it constituted a geographical boundary between the Western Isles, which were denominated Northern or Southern, according to their position in respect to this promontory. As might be expected, vessels are not unfre- quently cast on shore in some of its indentations, or dashed to a thousand fragments on its rocks. At a creek on the extreme point, as wild and desolate a spot as can well be conceived, a few green mounds, among the brown and withered herbage, indicate where the mutilated bodies of shipwrecked seamen rest below. The advantage of erecting a light-house here will, it is believed, not be denied by any one. The only other headland, of more than local notoriety, is Rheu Arasaig, or the Point of Arasaig, which projects considerably to the westward, and is a place of call for the steamers plying from Glasgow to Skye and the Long Island. â™? The only island worth noticing is Island Shona, which nearly blocks up the mouth, and occupies great part of Lochmoidart. It is about three or four miles long, by about one and a-balf broad, mostly composed of masses of rock, rather scantily covered with heath and wood, but exhibiting here and there spots of great verdure and fertility. The dwelling-house and surrounding sce-^ nery of the residence of a respectable family on this bland, are very beautiful. Sands. â€” Wherever sandy beaches are found, they seem to be formed in great part, sometimes, though rarely, entirely of de- composed particles of the adjacent rocks. This, however, is ge- nerally largely mixed with minutely broken shells, often with clay, and more or less according as the situation is exposed to, or shel' tered from the violence of the sea, with mud, the residue of de- cayed sea-weed, and the vegetable deposits of streams* Two kinds of shell sand, in .high repute as manure, are found in banks above, or beds under the surface. One seems to be a collection, pure and unmixed, of common shells, minutely broken by the * Tbe other headlands most noted are, Ardnish, in Arasaig ; Smirapary, in Moi- dnrt : Ardriminish, Sunna, Sron CUoinn GbiUeain, Hatha Ghlinn Borodail, Don- j^allan, in Ardnamurchan. Digitized by Google audnamurchan. 131 force of the waves. Of this there is a bank at Ardtoe, in Ard- DamurchaD. The other, and the most valued, is formed of small coral like pieces, having often several branches similar to that substance, and mariy matter, and is found in layers about a foot thick under six or seven inches of common sand at Kilchoan and Ardtoe, in Ardnamurchan. At the latter place, it has been found to answer on being well worked with a trowel, without any admix- t<ire, as a tolerable plaster for the dry stone cottages of the in- Iiabitants. The chief deposit of this sand is an inexhaustible bank at the ledge of rocks which run across the mouth of Loch- nakeaul, in Arasaig, whence it is conveyed to the distance of fifty and sixty miles. There is also a bed of marly shell sand, totally different from either of those just mentioned, found at the west end of LochshieU Sands ofKintra. â€” West of the great moss flat of Kintra, situ- ated betwixt the sea and Locbshiel, and bounding the flat in that direction, extends the beach or sands of Kintra. This is an ex- panse not less than two miles square, nearly circular in form, over which the sea flows only at high water, and to no great depth, consisting of fine light-coloured sand, the debris of primitive rocks, mixed with large proportions of shell sand, decomposed land and marine plants, sonoe day, and doubtlessly a great quantity of ani- mal matter derived from the mussels, cockles, and other shell-fish with which it abounds. The sea being admitted by a narrow in- let, seems very capable of exclusion by an embankment; the streams from inland are equally susceptible of being collected in- to a canal for conveyance of materials to and from the very mar- gin of the great moss. The substance of the moss and the sands affording the best manure for each other, seem placed by nature in juxtaposition for mutual improvement, and present an inviting field for the investiture of great capital At the head of Loch Moidart, there is also an extent of beach exposed, at low water, about one and a-half mile long and a-half broad. It is chiefly composed of deep soft clay, mingled with the substances just mentioned, as component parts of the sands of Kintra. There is also a beach of considerable extent at the head of Loch A inert ; one of white srlicious sand on the coast of Loch Morir ; and an- other of the 6an>e description at Bnnna, near the point of Ardna^ morchan. Meteorology. â€” No meteorological record has been kept in the Digitized by Google 1*32 AROYLESHIRE. parish, except observations with the thernioineter and t>aroineter, (from which the following has been obtained,) kept by Colonel Ro- bertson Macdonald of Kinloehmoidart. 1634. 1885. 1836. 1887. 1886. Meuof Mean of Mean of Mean of Mean of Thn.

Snow, which scarcely ever falls heavily, seldom lasts longer than twenty-four hours on the low grounds, though on the higher hills it may continue for months. Frost is generally not severe nor of long duration. The great drawback of the climate is frequent and violent gales of wind, which greatly interrupt, and render perilous travelling by sea, a common mode of communication ; sometimes they do much damage to stoidingcrops, and, it is believed, destroy winter grass and foggage more than the cold of that season. Providing shelter from the wind could be obtained, it ifl the opi* nion of competent judges, that any plants or flowers grown in South Britain might be raised. Sometimes, however, frost, dur- ing night, blights the blosom of iruit trees in the end of April and begimiing of May, Diuaats. â€” The prevailing complaints are, oommoa colds, in- fluenza, erysipelas, and diseases of the stomacfau Pulmonary con- sumption was, for some years, rather prevalent in the valley of Strontian, and scrofula in the Inverness shire districts^ The last has been accounted for by intermarriages with persons constitu- tionally liable to that disease, to which it is said the people have no reluctance ; but as there is no ground for the supposition that they were at any former period more scrupulous, it may with more probability be attributed to the moist and variaUe cUtnate, operas ing on constitutions relaxed by scanty and innutritive diet. Rheu- matism and inflammatory ailments, tJkough attributable in 80inÂ» degree to the climate, are not so frequent as might be expectedk Infectious fevers are of frequent^ in truth of annual occurrence ; Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. \sb but in every case, at least for the last ten years, have been im- ported from the great towns of the south, generally by home sick convalescent patients, to whom the steamers now afford every fa- cility^ to return to their homes. Experience of their fatal effects has happily taught the people such caution, that these diseases now seldom spread beyond the family aÂ£3icted. Upon the whole, the climate with all its inconveniences, is very healthy. Geology. â€” So far as the writer can ascertain, there has been no geo- logical survey of the parish. About ten miles of Ardnamurchan, east from the headland or point, appears to be of the trap series ; in this it accords with the opposite coast of Morvern, and that of Mull on the sound of that island. The prevailing rocks are whin- stone. With these are interspersed extensive beds of limestone of a fine-grained slaty rock, of light greyish blue colour, and some hard sandstone. The west face of the headland is in many parts pene- trated by numberless whin dikes, or veins of basalt, intersecting each other in all directions, of one striking instance of which, a correct plate is given in Dr Macculloch's third volume on the He- brides. The rock, however, is not limestone, as there represented, ' but hard sandstone of a similar colour. Organic remains in the fossil state are contained in great quantities in a rock at the point of Ormsaig Big, on the south side of this headland. In a neigh* bouring hill, pitchstone is found, and glance coal in the hill of Bensheand. Iron and copper ores are said in Sir Alexander Mur- ray's Survey, to exist in the same neighbourhood. The founda- tion of the older or primitive rocks, on which the foundations above- mentioned rest, protrude in many instances on the sea shores, and are distinctly traceable on the north coast especially, for miles^ from a place not far from the point. To this series belongs the whole wide extent of the parish, with the exception, perhaps, of a few small superincumbent masses of crumbling rock near Lochna^ keaul, the country being composed of gneiss, mica-slate, a fine- grained kind of the latter, which quarries into broad, tolerably smooth flags, and at Strontian of granite. Here, as is well known, lead ore abounds, as well as Strontium, so named on account of its being there first discovered. Traces of- lead ore are also found in the hills of Dallella, and Lachans in Moi- darl; SotVs. â€” These where arable, with the exception of some parts of Digitized by Google 134 AUGYLE8H1BB. Ardnamiirchfttt, are light aud friable^ consistiag of decomposed mineral and vegetable particles^ washed from the mountaios by the rains or streams, or of reclaimed mess.

These de* serve a more scientific and particular description than can here be given. They consist of two veins ; one, termed steel ore, on accouni of its hardness and iron grey colour, is said to be rich in silver ; but is difficult to smelt, though producing excellent lead. The direction of this vein is from south-^ast to north-west, with a slight dip to the north. The working or vein is about eight feet wide* the wails granite, and an opening havrng been made on the slope of the hill in which it is situated, it is entered by a level passage through this without a shaft. On the other vein, there are several openings or shafts, some of which are 100 fathoms deep. This vein is at one spot thirty feet wide ; its bearing a few points more to east and west than that of the former, aud its dip slightly to the * south. It is crossed from north to south by a whin dike^ nineteen feet wide, besides others of less size. The walls are granite or gneiss. There are various riders, as the miners term them, of quartz, apart from the walls, rising abruptly in the very centre of the vein, and splitting into parts for several yards, and terminating at once. These are left by the miner, but the blue stone or calc spar, in which the galena is imbedded, is totally removed, and the ore afterwards separated before smelting. II. â€” Civil History. There appears to be no doubt that the entire parish fornaed part of the possessions of Somerled, the celebrated Thane or Regulus of Argyle, whose mainland conquests, moreover, are supposed, with great probability, to have been the dominions of his ances- tors. After his death in 1 164, it would seem that the superiority of these lands had been wrested, by the efforts of successive ijcot- tish Kings, from the descendants of that warlike and able chief. At any rate, the first authentic notices of them are grants of Alex- ander III. in 12B3, of Ardnamurclian and Maruin to Angus Mar of Isla, and of the lordship of Garmoran to Allan MacRuariy both heads of powerful houses descended from Somerled. Moi- dart, Arasaig, and South Morir, with adjacent districts to the north, had by this time been formed into the lordship above-mentioned, Digitized by Google AnDVAMURCHAN. 135 tv'hile it would appear that Ardnamurchan and Sui>art were in- cluded in the province of Bngadia or Argyle, an arrangement which was retained, when with the extension of the royal authori- ty, the whole kingdom was divided into sheriffdoms. According to tradition,^ Ardnamurchan was the possession of ^* Muchdragan Mac Ri Lochlunn/' a tyrannical and licentious Norwegian Prince, who claimed an abominable privilege, against the toleration of which in Scotland there is conclusive evidence adduced by Lord Hailes, which the following narrative corroborates : A man named â™?* Evun Cleireach,** " Evun Clerk," the celebrated beauty of whose wife had attracted the notice of Muchdragan, having received intimation of an intended visit from the latter, well knowing the infamous consequences, prepared, by a singularly bold and ingeni- ous expedient, to maintain the honour of his family, and avenge the insult On the day appointed, be alone met the Lord of Ardna- murchan and his retinue, on the northern side^of Benhianda hill, at the foot of which he resided, armed solely with his *^ Tuaghairm*' or battle axe, and dressed in a cassock or long shirt, sown so loose- ly in its different parts as merely to retain its shape. Â«As they rested conversing on different sides of the path, Evun suddenly, by a dexterous cast, sunk his battle-axe in the skull of the unsuspect* ing Norseman, and fled up a hollow which led to the summit of Benheand, pursued by Muchdragan's followers. His loose sown robe did him noble service. When near the summit the foremost pursuer seized it, but the piece, as was intended, coming away with him, he fell back on those immediately behind, and tumbled with them down the hill. One or more met the same fate, and Evun, though in a state of nudity, escaped to the southern foot of Ben- heand where, during the previous night, he had concealed his wife and family in a six-oared boat, and plied oars and sails, without once casting anchor, until he arrived in Islay. The hollow up which Evun ran is still called ** Glac na Coiridb,'^ the hollow of the race or pursuit, the hiU itself, '* Bean na hurchrach," the hill of the cast or throw. The cairn erected on the spot where the Norse leader was slain, is still known under the name of << Carn Mhuckdragain,"^ Muchdragan's cairn, and the rock at which Evun embarked, under that of ** Sgair cbuV Eilhin," the rock of the nook of Evun. Evun having taken refuge with the larl Islach, Lord of kla, the latter was induced, by his representations* to send his soq John with an armament to take possession of Ardnamurchan ; from which John or Ian are descended the clan Ian, so long the pro- Digitized by Google 136 ARGYLESHIRE. prietors of Ardnamurchan and Sunart. History confirms the Oc- eupancy of this district by John, the son of Angus Mor, on whom tradition bestows the designation of larl or Earl of Islay, as well as the fact of the former being the progenitor of the clan Ian of Ardna* murchan. The grant of 1283 marks, though not with the preei* sion of modem charters, the date of the passing of Ardnamurchan into the possession of John of Isla, for that event may have pre- ceded, or followed it in times when royal charters were often merely the confirmation of rights already assumed, or a means of obtaining them along with the more powerful agency of the swofd* The somewhat remarkable tradition of a Norse noble being in possession about this period, is not invalidated by the fact of the predominance of the native race having been completely establish- ed on the mainland districts by the valour and talents of Somerled about a century previously, or the cession of the kingdom of the Isles itself to the. Scottish king in 1366. Ardnamurchan, po* jecting so far into the. open sea, was in the direct course of every Norse invasion, and the centre of the Norwegian principality of the lsle&; and being, moreover, connected with the mainlandooly by a narrow isthmus or tarburt, over which boats were not unfrequently drawn from sea to sea, â€” (a circumstance which suggested to Magnus Barefoot the stratagem by which the more valuable and extensive peninsula of Kintyre was made part of that principality,) may have anciently been held as part of the Norwegian territories. At any rate, Muchdragan may have held of the king or some great Gaelic chief. The district may, therefore, with all probability, be consi- dered as the last footing of the once victorious Norwegians on the west continent of Scotland, while in the deed of Evun we behoM the final blow to the relics of their power. Angus Og, son of An* gus Mor above-mentioned, the faithful adherent of Briice^ was con* firmed in the possession of the district by that monarch. Of him his brother continued to hold the lands, and transmitted them to bis descendants, who possessed them as holdings from the Lord of the Isles, with their other domains, until the forfeiture of the laU ter in 1493^ when the clan Ian became vassals of the crown. There seems to be no doubt that the district of Sunart was, from the time of their accession to Ardnamurchan, in the posaessioo of this family ; its position, in the absence of any documents showing it to have been held by any other, warrants the assertion. About 1493, claims to it were asserted by another branch of the house of Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. 137 Somerled) at which period the right of M^laoi the actual pos- sessor, was established by royal charter. The high rank of this family in the Highlands and Isles was maintained by no mean share of ability. When James IV. visited the Highlands to quell the insurgent nobles of the forfeited lord- ship of the Isles, M^Ian, whose castle in Ardnamurchan the King bad selected to receive the homage of the island chiefs, displayed uncomoaon zeal and intrepidity in support of the authority of the Crown, and, singularly enough, against the head of bis own house, Sir John of Islay, and Sir Alexander of Lochalsh, the heir of the Lord of. the Isles. The first he apprehended in Islay, with his three sons, and took to Edinburgh, where they were executed* He was concerned in the assassination of the latter. His unscru- pulous loyalty procured him high favour and rich rewards from the King, but drew upon him the fierce vengeance of the houses of Isla and Lochalsh, who, after the death of James IV., united their forces, wasted his lands with fire and sword, sacked his castle, and slew himself and his two sons in battle, some time before 1519. Moriada, his grand*daughter aud heiress, resigned, (it is not known for what cause,) with consent or her husband, Robertson of Strowan, the superiority of Ardnamurchan and Suinart to Archi- bald, Earl of Argyle. For about sixty years thereafter, the heirs- male retained possession, in complete independence of the Earl, either on the plea of their Crown charters, or, more probably, on consuetudinal right and Gaelic rules of succession. Feuds, however, arose among the leading men of the clan. << Angus mor mac vie EAn^'* uncle of the chief Donald Cooallach, endeavoured to hold possession of Suinart on his own account. A reconciliation having apparently been efiected, the latter passed through Suinart to visit Allan nan Creach, << Allen the forayer,'* Lord of liochiel, to whose daughter he was betrothed ; and on his return, with only an ordinary retinue, was laid wait for and foully murdered by his savage unde at a pass in the north of Ardnamur* chan, still named ** Faothil Dhonuil Chonallaich." It is said that Lochiel, on seeing his daughter weep, exclaimed, ^^ For every tear you shed, I will give cause for ten." It is certain that Angus Mor was soon after met by this chief in Morven, and there was slain by an archer in his train, who nailed his hand to his forehead as he raised his visor to take a better view of the enemy.* This took * The death of thn ferodous warrior* m rehted by ftradition^ was ehanclerittie. As be lay dyini^) he requested Loebiel to receive his swordÂ» being unwilling to yield Digitized by Google 138 ARGYLESHine. place ia 1596, and while the elan Ian were tbus weakened by in- testine broils, the occasion was seized by Argyle to enforce the not forgotten deed of Moriada. A negotiation appears to have been commenced, of which it was the basis. The title-deeds of the heir of Macvic Eoin came into the possession of Argyle, tra- dition says, by his having found them with a burgess of Edinburgh, with whom M'^Ian left them as a pledge for a debt incurred in educating his son. In 1602, M^Ian became, by a special agree- ment, vassal of Argyle, and in a few years it would seem that the superior acquired the righto of actual proprietor. The clan were, as might be expected from their ignorance of feudal rights, refractory. Mr Donald Campbell of Basleriek,afterws^rds Sir Donald of Ardna- murchan, a man of uncommon depth of policy and inflexible resolution, was appointed by Argyle, his commissioner, to reduce them to obedi- ence. Campbell, by a combination of cruelty and insult, soon goaded the clansmen to violence, and, in 1624, twenty-two years after the contract with Argyle, we find them driven to absolute despe- ration, and above 100 of their fighting men, in an English ship which they had seized, carrying terror as pirates throughoot the north-western coasts of Scotland. The close of their history fol- lowed speedily. They fell under the vengeance of Government and chiefs whose lands they had plundered, and were either ex- tirpated by the sword, or driven mto exile with an unsparing se^ verity which left not even their name behind. Sir Donald Camp- bell became proprietor of Ardnamurchan, and the race of Ian were no more seen in the roll of Highland clans. The lands being thus most effectually quieted, they were repeopled by Sir Donald with the clan Ian, and clan Henry, or Hendersons of Glencoe with their followers, who came in a body to take posses* sion of Ardnamurchan, while Sunart appears to have been reple>- nished by families of the clan Cameron. If we add to these a sept of M'Kenzies, introduced afterwards by Campbell of Loch" nell, we have the clans most prevalent to this day in both districts. In 1644, the celebrated Alexander McDonald, son of Coll Ci- toch, or the left-handed, commander of Montrose's Irish troops, landed in Ardnamurchan, ravaged the country with fire and sword,. it to one of inferior station. As Lochlel approached, he made a blow at him with such force as to cut several ant-hills in its sweep, though it missed LochieL The armour in which he died was long retained at Aeham in MorTen. His shield is stilt preserved at Laudal in that district An old man in Ardnamurchan, still aHhrt, thou^ approaching 100 years, has often seen and put on his mail-shirtÂ» 4l Digitized by Google AKDNAMURCHAN. 139 and retained possession for a considerable time, though bis garri* son in the castle were assailed by one of Argyle's most intrepid and able partizans. Sir Donald died * without issue, the lands consequently reverted to the stiperior, and came soon afterwards into the possession, it is believed by purchase, of Campbell of Lochnell. While the estate was in possession of this family, the inhabitants suffered no violence from without, but were in a state of great internal disorganization, the arm of legal authority being weak and ineffectual. In evidence of this, and of the manners of the people nearly two centuries ago, two incidents may be worth recording. The clans located in Ardnamurchan and Sunart felt the tie which bound them to the heads of their tribes, little weakened by residing on the lands of another proprietor. A widow of the clan Cameron having been dispossessed of a farm in Ardnamurchan by a tenant belonging to another sept or family of the same clan, her husband's brother, a bold and fiery character, applied to his chief, Lochiel, for redress ; but failing in this, resolved to effect his purpose by open force. With his eldest son, he proceeded at once to the residence of the new tenant, who, well knowing their object, advanced to meet them with his son, and first fired upon the assailants. The elder assailant brought his enemy to the ground at the first fire mortally wounded, while the sons en* gaged each other with their swords ; but, as be hastily approach- ed, bis foot slipped, and be fell forward upon bis prostrated oppo* ueut, who received him upon the point of his sword, and, as they both lay in their blood, said, with a mixture of feelings it is difii-^ cult to analyze, ^' Here are two gallant falcons on one spit.'* The son of the assailant alone survived, having slain bis antago- nist, and the affair ended by the re-instalment of the widow in her farm, which remained in lineal possession of her descendants until about six or seven years ago. At this time, it is singular that a direct descendant of the other party in the tragedy above-men- tioned, managed to obtain possession, and that the occupancy of the farm, though decided as such cases now a-days usually are, was contested by the parties, chiefly from motives connected with the feud of their ancestors, affording a solitary instance, in so peaceful a district, of the cherished remembrance of such ancient quarrels, embittering the intercourse of private life. * There is a portrait of Sir Donald at Airds, the mansion of the inheritor of his title and estate*.

Of bis crafty and nefarious exploits, many stories are still told. He stole in one night the cattle of the neighbour- ing Isle of Muck, and shot to death the proprietor, a brave and strong man, while defending his property. He is said to bafe been tried for the crime, and escaped the gallows by the evidence of Sir Duncan Campbell of Lochnell, whom he had prepared as the unconscious instrument of his exculpation. Sir Duncan swore that Maclan Gheir, whose manners were remarkably mild and insinuating, was, on the night in question, in Mingary Castk, and, at the time, he fell asleep at his bed-side, relating a '^ sqeu? lachd'' or tale, and that when he awoke in the morning he was there also, when he resumed the thread of the story. This de- position was perfectly true, but the deponent was not aware that, during the interval, the robbery and murder had been committed, a fact not impossible. In the beginning of the last century, Ardnamurchan and Sunart appear to have come into the possession of Sir Alexander Mur- ray of Stanhope, Bart, an extraordinary man, whose sagacity readily discovered the chief points of civil and industrial improve- ment of which these lands were susceptible ; but whose over*specula- tiveand sanguine temperament, transgressing the bounds of sobriety and sound sense, rendered his efforts abortive, and were probably the cause of his pecuniary embarrassments. By him the vegetable and mineral resources of the estate were thoroughly investigated ; a minute census of the population and account of the stock taken, and preserved in a curious document yet extant; the estate itself was subjected to an accurate survey, a chart of Looh Sunart, pub- lished by a Lieutenant Bruce, to which notes were appended, evi- dently from the pen of Sir Alexander Murray, and plans of har- bours and other improvements prepared by the latter. A system of draining and irrigation was commenced upon an immense scale, of which some useful traces are yet visible ; and the lead mines of Strontian were let by him to the York Building Company. These mines are well understood to have been worked at a far earlier pe- riod, though said by Sir Alexander to have been discovered by himself in 1722, and held forth to the public as ** the most won- derful discovery of the age." But it is certain that, through his instrumentality, operations commenced with great spirit, and on a large scale. An English mining settlement, which employed 500 individuals, was established with all its accessories of buildings, ma- Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. i^i chinery, and roads. A village was built, and named New York, after the custom of settlers in other remote colonies; and many of the arts of peace, hitherto unknown, were introduced among the war- like Highlanders* Of all this Sir Alexander Murray had just rea- son to feel proud. These mines continued, until about twenty years ago, the source of considerable reyenue to the proprietor and the company, and of profitable industry to numerous families employ- ed by the proprietor until within a few years back, notwithstanding chat the ploughshare has long ago obliterated every vestige of New York, and the English workmen, unless we except a few of their descendants (undisdnguishable except by their Saxon names,) supplanted by hardy and industrious natives. Sir Alexander and some of his tenants were much harassed by the destruction of their eattle, and other annoyances,â€” a fact accounted for by his zealous loyalty to the reigning family* In 1715 and 1745, many of the inhabitants of these districts join- ed in the insurrections of these periods. On the suppression of the last, a ship of war came to lay waste the country, but the mi- Bister and factor succeeded, by their representations, in saving the inhabitants from the indiscriminate cruelties to which the High- landers were at the time subjected. The abolition of heri- table jurisdictions at this era does not appear, for some time, to have been followed by the better protection of the national laws and functionaries. Depredations on cattle were frequent in Ard- namurchan and Sunart, the robbers coming principally from dis- tricts farther inland. This chiefly arose from the exile and death of so many chiefe and gentlemen, who (clan feuds and forays hav- ing ceased long before) were the natural and most influential ma- gistracy. Themass of the people, however, were, even at this period, orderly and docile, to a certain extent industrious, and under the influence of their religious instructors ; and the depredators, who were never numerous, either died, or soon found that the age of their vocation had gone. The Inverness-shire districts of the parish appear to have re- mained in' the possession of the family of Allan â€¢'Mac Ruari, until 1987, when they came to be inherited by Amie, the sister of the last heir-male* This lady married John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, and by this union the race of Somerled was continued in the male as well as female line. From Ranald, the son of this John, are descended the Clanranald, a bold and resolute clan, who maia^ tained, in. many fierce conflicts, tlieir Celtic privileges, and the Digitized by Google U2 AUGYLBSHIflE. honour of their high descent By them was fought at Loch Lochy the celebrated battle of Blar Leine, in which Ranald the stranger, the legal heir, but repudiated by the tribe, was slain, and his brother, Ian Muidartach, established in his place. In the pos- session of the descendants of the last, the whole lands, with the exception of a few small portions, remained, until not many years ago, when the estates of Moidart and Arasaig were sold by the present chief, Ranald George MacDonald of Clanranald. Still extensive tracts remain in possession of cadets of that houseÂ« In 1715, the inhabitants of this part of the parish followed their chief in the insurrection of that year. His death, at the battle of Sheriffmuir, is honourably recorded in Sir Walter Scott*s Tales of a Grandfather. AH that is known of this chieftain attaches a romantic interest to his character. He is said to have been train* ed to arms in the wars of the continent, and once that he lay wounded on a field of battle, to have been conveyed thence, and carefully attended, until his recovery, by an Italian lady, named Penelope, whom he afterwards married, and who accompanied him to Moidart. That he was a disinterested, zealous, and gallant ad* herent of the Stuart femily, is unquestionable. He stormed and retook his castle of Eilein Terim from the troops of the Govern- ment, and, rather than it should prove of use to the enemy in sub- jugating the country, this ancient stronghold of his race was, by his orders, destroyed by fire. The warlike character of the people, their well-known attachment to his family, and the almost inacces- sible nature of their country, probably induced Prince Charles Ed- ward to select it for the commencement of the insurrection whith excited such terrific interest in 1745 and 1746. This selection, whatever may be thought of the prudence of the undertaking it- self, was made with judgment. In truth, the very local scenery was appropriate* In the dusky recesses of these mountains, the footsteps of the arming clans were unheard ; their mustering un* noted. Glenfinnan, where, in a few days after his landing, Charles gave his banner to the winds, was of all places the best fitted for the purpose. It is a plain at the east end of Lochshiel; encircled by rugged mountains. Upon this plain, a<) on a common centre, open the mouths of several wild and shadowy glens, through which the first squadrons of the Highland army marched to the ren- dezvous* Through these glens also, notice of the event was trans- mitted to all the tribes of the north ; and those whom prudence might yet cause to linger, roused to arms by the stirring announce^ Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. 143 ment. After the discomfiture of the Highland army at Culloden^ these districts were laid waste with fire and sword, and subjected to the fullest measure of the vengeance which, although per- petrated by the army of civilized Britain, rivalled the savage cruelty of the most barbarous age. The only remission was ex- perienced by the families of some unfortunate gentlemen, through the generous exertions and influence of Campbell of Airds, the inheritor of the estates, but neither of the unrelenting disposition Dor crooked policy, nor of any of the darker features of character .of Sir Donald of Ardnamurchan. In all probability, the Reformed religion was introduced into the parish, under the protection of the noble family of Argyle, whose services to the Protestant faith, and enlightened patriotism, far more than counterbalance, though they do not, in any shape, palliate their share in the unscrupulous and cruel policy of times of confusion and turbulence. In 1639, the record of the synod of Argyle begins. In that year we find a minister of the Church of Scotland, already established in Ardnamurchan. The Reforma- tion, so far as regards the eradication of Popery, was successful in Ardnamurchan and Sunart, the districts under Argyle influence. One clergyman, however, was all wi^h which the Church of Scot- land could supply a parish, where there are twelve places of wor- ship. After the final settlement of the Church in 1688, there were, in consequence of the extreme paucity of Gaelic preachers, long vacancies in the parish, supplied only by occasional deputa- tions from the ministers of Lorn and Argyle. Protestant Episco% pacy seems to have prevailed for some time before and after the Revolution, a minister of that persuasion being stationed in Ard- namurchan ; but the members of that sect seem, with few excep- tions, soon to have merged in the establishment. By the appoint- ment of missionaries on the Royal Bounty, the means of religious instruction received a powerful addition, but still the districts in Inverness-shire were left; under the care of one assistant minister ; and even on the erection of the churches lately built and endowed by Government, only a small part comparatively of that wide por- tion of the parish could, without undue extension of the bounds of the adjoining Government minister, be attached to his church. It is, therefore, more matter for wonder, that the parishioners in Argyleshire should, from the period of their first conversion, (not- withstanding the strenuous and elsewhere successful efforts of the Romish priests, continued until the latter part of the last century-, Digitized by Google .144 ARGYLESHIRE. have been retained in the possession of Protestantism) than that the light of the Reformation should not have been extended to those in Inverness-shira In that rugged and secluded quarter some influential families of old descent, and the whole of the abo- riginal inhabitants, are Roman Catholics; of the Protestants^ who amount only to a sixth part of the population, very few beads of families have been born there* There are no maps or plans of the whole parish, but it is believ- ed, all the landed proprietors have plans of their estates. In the possession of Sir James Milles RiddellÂ» there is a curious collec- tion of the works of Sir Alexander Murray of Stanhope, entitled ^' The true interest of Great Britain displayed," in which there are maps, plans, and statements illustrative of the statistics of his estate in the parish. In the possession of the same gentleman there is also a ^^ plan of Loch Sunart," with a map of Ardna- rourchan and Sunart, published by Alexander Bruce in 1733, d^ dicated to General Wade, Commander-in-Chief in Scotland; also in possession of Mr Campbell of Lerax, near Oban, ^^ The Ana- tomy of Ardnamurchan and Sunart," the result of a minute sur- vey of these districts taken by Sir Alexander Murray.

The parochial regis- ters extend not back beyond fifty years, and are very defective, be- ing irregularly kept, and referring only to portions of the parish* Eminent Persons. â€” The personages connected with the parish renowned in Highland chivalry are numerous. Characters dis- tinguished by civil eminence are few. Among the hitter, Sir Alexander Murray, for his activity and eccentric intelligence, is remarkable. Alexander McDonald, or, as he is generally desig- nated, ^^ Alaster MacMhaighistin Alaster," from his father, Epi&- copal minister of Ardnamurchan, was a native of that district, and in the year 1745 parochial schoolmaster and elder of that parish, when he embraced the Romish religion, and took arms for the Prince. He was a celebrated bard, and left behind him poems of exquisite beauty. He has been justly reprehended for the inde- cency of some of his productions, but it is due to his memory to state, that, for these in his latter days, he was deeply penitent Dr Donald Mac Lean, M. D., was also born in Ardnamurchan, where he long resided. He inherited from his father, a worthy and much respected individual, and an extraordinary humorist and wit, no small share of his peculiarities, and was a man of talent and information, particularly distinguished by his knowledge of Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. 146 Highland antiquities. He wrote for the London Literary Gazette gome li^ht and amusing sketches of Highland superstitions, and was also the author of a treatise on diseases of the nerves. Constantly occupied with schemes for the public benefit, some of. which he communicated to Government, and for one of which, at least, he received the thanks of the late Duke of York, he neÂ«* glected, as too often happens with such persons, his private aflFairs, ond at last fell a victim to the use of opium.

On this islet, an abrupt and irregular mass of fine mica-slate, are two works of this description, within a few yards of each other, one of an oblong fi* gure, 140 paces in circumference, the other 90 paces and circuÂ« lar. The walls which, in some parts, are seven or eight feet high, are composed of stones of various sizes heaped confusedly, and ce- mented by vitrified matter, nowhere solid or compact At the en- trance to the largest, there are the remains of a facing of com- mon stone imbedded in cement, which probably extended, at one time, all round the fort. Within, the area is not level, but a deep hollow like an inverted cone, and strongly resembling the extinct crater of a volcano.* The Castle of Mingary, the ancient hold of Mac Ian, is $ituÂ«- ated on the southern shore of Ardnamurchan, about five or six miles from the point. Its shape is rather irregular, being adapted to the site ; it is broadest on the land side, on which it is protect- ed by a foss, over which there was once a drawbridge, and narrow- est towards the sea which it overhangs. On this side the rock has been scarped and rendered perpendicular. There is an en- trance on the north or land side across the west end of the ditch, and another on the south, communicating with the sea by a narrow exposed stair hewn out of the rock. On the top, there is a ram- part with embrasures all round, and several loop holes in the lower parts of the building. The interior consists of a large house of * It is a fact which the writer has seen exemplified, that common sod subjected to strong beat fuses into a sulxtance similar to the cement of Titrtfied forts.

These were erected, it is said, by Campbell of Lochnell, more than a century and a*balf ago. The floors, rafters, and boards of the roof are all of mas- sive oak, the slates of an extraordinary size, fastened by oaken pins. When or by whom this castle was built is unknown. In 1493^ James IV. granted a charter from this castle, and in 1495, again held his court to receive the submission of the nobles of the for- feited lordship of the isles. It is supposed by Gregory to have been razed to the ground by Sir Donald of Lochalsh in 1517 ; but it is most probable that the greater portion of the outer wall, which is of great strength, thickness, and apparent antiquity, was left standing on that occasion. In 1588, it was besieged for three days by Sir Lachlan Maclean of Duart, one of the most daring warriors and ablest leaders of the Highlands, aided by 1(H) soldiers of the Florida, a ship of the Spanish Armada, which had taken shelter in the adjoining harbour of Tobermory. The siege was raised in consequence of the approach of the northern clans under the orders of Government. In 1644, the garrison of Sir Donald Campbell in this castle were forced to surrender to Montrose's general, Alaster Macdonald, by the simple expedient of piling the thatch and timber of all the houses in the vicinity against the walls and setting them on fire. On this occasion, un- wonted guests were brought to this rude hold. Un bis way thither, Alaster had captured the vessel in which three Scottish ministers, who had been preaching the gospel and spreading the covenant in Ireland, were returning to their native country, Messrs Weir, Hamilton, and Watson, whom, with the wife of the first, and several other respectable passengers, he, on the 15th July, imi>risoned in Mingary Castle. Here they seem to have been destitute of all comfort but the consolations of religion. Their sufferings were terribly aggravated by an unsuccessful attempt of the Marquis of Argyle to liberate them. During seven weeks' leaguer by his troops, their food was rye bruised between stones, and the green muddy water collected on the bartizans of the castle. On the 8d of Sep- tember, Mrs Weir was liberated, and on the 23d, all the captives, except the three ministers, who were kept close, by Alaster's or- ders, with the view of exchanging them for his father and two brothers, then prisoners with Argyle.

Mr Watson sunk under his suffer- ings and died in the month of March following ; but Mr Hamil- ton was graciously preserved until, after many efforts on the part of the General Assembly and the Scottish parliament to procure the release of this esteemed minister, he was at length, by an exchange of prisoners, liberated on the 8d May 1645, after an imprison- ment often months." (Orthodox Presbyterian, July 1837.) Castle Tirom, the castle of the Clanranald, a building^ 130 yards in circumference, in shape adapted to the rock on which it is built, is situated on an islet in Loch Moidart, named Eilien Ti- rom or dry island, being connected with the mainland by a nar- row neck, overflowed only at high water. Its tall battlements or turrets, with the surrounding scenery, give it an imposing appear- ance. Being nev^er repaired since burnt by Clanranald about 1715, it is a total ruin, only the exterior walls and a few vaulted chambers within now remaining. There is a tradition that the troops of Cromwell penetrated io this remote fortalice and held it for a time. At Ormsaig mor in Ardnamurchan, there are some large stones so placed as to resemble a rude altar, round which a circle of smaller stones may be traced. It is called ^^ Griadal Fhinn," FingaPs Griddle. . There are also in different parts a few rude obelisks or upright stones, and stone coffins have been found con- taining, as usual, coarse earthen urns. At Ormsaig beg there are the remains of a very small tower, dignified by the name of ** Cas- ual due nan Clior,'' the black Castle of the Minstrels. Of ancient places of worship there are numerous vestiges. At these, the inhabitants still continue to bury their dead. At Eilien Finnan in Lochshiel, the walls of the ancient parish church, dedi- cated to that saint, are still standing. It appears to have been a small rude edifice, rudeness remarkably characterizing the tombs of the common people around. A very sweet-toned, angular, an- tique hand bell remains on its stone table or altar; and until with^ in a few years since, the alleged skull of the warrior who slew Ranald the stranger at Blarliene, by stratagem, marked by deep dints from the sword of Ranald, to whom tradition attributes un- mastered prowess.

It is a handsome mansion-house, built by the pre- sent chief of Clanranald, of polished freestone, a material import- ed at great expense, with interior accommodations beBtting the seat of a distinguished family. The present parish church is a durable and well constructed edifice, built after a plan by Mr Burn of Edinburgh. The stone chiefly used was a micaceous rock, brought by sea from primitive rocks about tweWe miles to the eastward, â€” the buttresses, belfry, and sides of windows are of free> stone from Glasgow. The farm offices of Drimantorran, near Strontian, are worthy of notice for their extent, and admirable adaptation to their purpose. The residences of the proprietors are generally plain comfortable buildings suited to the climate, the more recently erected showing a due regard to ornament At Glenfinnon, a tower with apartments attached was erected by the late amiable and much lamented Alexander MacDonald of Glenaladale, in commemoration of the event which took place there in 1745. The inscription, which he did not live to see placed, was written by Dr Donald Maclean, already alluded to, highly approved by the late Sir Walter Scott, and translated into Latin by the late celebrated Dr Gregory of Edinburgh. The re- lative and successor of Glenaladale, Angus MacDonald, Esq. has of late improved this monument, having removed the buildings . annexed, so that the tower stands singly on the plain, and erected on the summit a statue of the Prince, to whom the gentlemen of his family were ardent adherents from the day of his landing, and not more in the hour of his fleeting triumphs than when a hunted wanderer in the caves of Arasaig and wilds of Moidart III. â€” Population. The population of the Argyleshire districts, as taken by Sir 'Alexander Murray in 1723, amounted to 278 families, â€” 408 men, 444 women, 600 children ; total, 1855. In 1 795, according to the last Statistical Account, they amount- ed to 470 families,â€” 1218 males, 1384 females; toUl, 2552. Families, numbering 124 individual members, emigrated to Ame* rica in 1790 and 1791. Since then, individuals and single fami* lies have been constantly emigrating to the low country or the co* Innies. In 1837 and 1838Â» not less than twenty families left Ardnamurchan and Suaart chiefly for Australia.

Yet the last Statistical Account gives a po- pulation of 375 families, â€” 908 males, 1082 females; total, 1990. About five years ago, thirteen families, amounting to about 70 individuals, emigrated to Canada. In 1837 and 1838, families, amounting to about 100 individuals, sailed for Australia. The whole population is rural ; there is not even an approach to a village^ except at Ardnafuaran, in Arasaig. The yearly average of births, for the last seren years, taken from the paroobial re- gisters in the Argylesbire or Protestant districts, b . 90f Yearly average for da of deaths, ... 44 Da marriages, .-1^ The number of persons under 15 years of age, in the Argylesbire distrieu, no return being procured from the other districts, . 1858 Number of persons betwixt 15 and 90, . 834 dOandSO, 614 50 and 70, . .388 above 70, ... 122 The number of families of independent fortune residing in the parish is nine ; of these, only one, viz. the sole proprietor, re- sides in Argylesbire.

Planted, the various kinds of firs, planetree, oak, and ash. Both plantations and woods appear ta be well managed, though, by several modes, sometimes the young wood is enclosed for seven or ten years, the tenant receiving an allowance for the loss of the pasture enclosed, which, being always wintering, is very considerable. In other c^ses, cattle are estcluded from the woods for fifteen or twenty years, and the woodlands then only pastured lightly, while, in others, the woodlands are enclosed permanently and never pastured at all. The last method is most subservient to appearance, that first mentioned to profit ; for, when profit is the object^ the sacrifice of so much low land, where wintering is so much wanted, is thought bad management The woods are thinned periodically. The oak, from the value of its bark, is held in most esteem, ' There is no arable land let separately. Some would estimate the proportion of rent applicable to it at L.1, 5s. to L.1, 10s. per acre, others at 10s. to 15s. Probably 15s. per acre may approach nearest the truth. The value of grazings varies according to the nature of the soil, situation, and other circumstances, some farms being consi- dered fairly rented at the rate of 1^2, 10s. per head of black- cattle, and ds. 6d. per sheep yearly, while others are not consi- dered profitable at L 1, 10s. for black-cattle, and Is. 6d. for sheep. The average rent over the parish is estimated at L.1, 15s. per head of black-cattle three years old and upwards, L.1 under that age, and fiill-grown sheep, 3sr 6d. Sheep and Black-Cattle, â€” The former are the black-faced, the latter chiefly the Argyleshire breed. Considerable improvement has been made on the breed of sheep by means of tups from the south ; but, it is believed, the sheep stock generally can never, owing to the poverty and thinness of the soil, and consequent in- feriority of pasture, be made equal to that of some neighbouring parishes. A great part of the land is better adapted for black- cattle, consequently a great number are kept, and fully more at- tention has been paid to their improvement than to that of the sheep. With regard to the management of stock and the cultivation of Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. 151 the ground, there is much diversity, in some cases arising from the nature of the country, in others, from the circumstances of the occupants. In some parts of Ardnamurchan and Moidart, there is neither horse nor plough, â€” the rocky and broken surface pre- cluding either. The sharp-pointed spade only is used in turning up the soil, and every article, even the sea-ware and other ma- nure, carried on the back in creels suited to the age and strength of the members of each family. These are by no mean& the most destitute of the class of small tenants and cottars. In other farms, where the ground is more level, the number of horses appears to be extravagant, seven or eight being kept for la- bour, which three, if not two, tolerable plough or cart horses could accomplish. They are, however, hardy horses or ponies, of 12 or 13 hands, which are, at all seasons, in the open air, and are sub- sbted at not more expense than the smallest number of stable- fed work-horses o/ the country, which could be substituted. Sometimes land on the steep sides of hills is seen diligently cul- tivated by the small tenants, which certainly no capitalist, from motives of profit, would crop ; while elsewhere land easily and pro- fitably improvable is left waste* In the one case, this arises from the crowded state of the population in localities not naturally adapted for agriculture, and the necessity, in the absence of bet- ter employment, of raising some crop at any rate ; in the other, not from any paucity of labour, but from inability to wait for the profits of the undertaking if they attempted it, and insufficient as- surance of reaping the profits if they did. When the extent of their lands admits of it, small tenants, commonly after potatoes, sow their land with bear, and then oats, â€” the soil, after being well manured for the first, producing very good bear, and rather infe- rior oats, which last, however, constitutes the best provender for cattle. When their land is not of sufficient extent to raise the three crops above-mentioned, they are compelled, in order to ob- tain a greater quantity of food, to confine themselves chiefly to potatoes. The stock, especially the sheep-stock of this class, is of an ex- ceedingly inferior description, and very ill managed. This, so far as their poverty permits, they are endeavouring to remedy, as yet without much success. In the cultivation of the ground, however, they have, in some parts, advanced considerably. Ten years ago, there was not one cart in the possession of the small tenants in the district of Ardnamurchan, and, in some parts, Digitized by Google 152 AKGYLESHIRIS. four horses, with a man at their heads walking backwards, after the ancient fashion, might be seen in the plough. Now, carts are not uncommon, several good iron ploughs are in use, additional manure is made, and crops are more abundant With all their disadvantages, the small tenants have hitherto paid to the full as high rents as the large farmers, â€” the money being procured by the joint exertions of the different members of their families* On the lands farmed by the proprietors, or let to large tenants or tacksmen, the system of management, both as respects tillage and stock, is far better ; in some cases, as good as in any part of Scotland. With some exceptions, the farm-buildings and enclo- sures are d^ective, those of the small tenants miserable. Leases run from seven to nineteen years. The principal improvements have of late years taken place on the estate of Ardnamurchan and Sunart; not to mention two Gh>- vemment churches which have been built on this property, to which the proprietor has given glebes of six acres each; also three Assembly schools, to which he has given crofts, and on the accommodations of which he has expended L. 870, â€” a good deal has been done in reclaiming waste land, building, enclosing, and other agricultural improvements. At Drimantarran on this pro- perty, Mr McDonald, the late enterprising tenant (who contributed most of the facts under this head, and thie estimate to be given of the gross returns of the parish,) has brought into cultivation and enclosed 25 to 30 acres of moss, varying from three to nine feet depth. The land was drained, trenched, and limed, at L.13, 5s. per English acre, manured with sea-ware, and fenced at an ex- pense not included in the above sum ; and being planted with po- tatoes, yielded twenty returns. Towards this the proprietor con- tributed L. 5 per acre, and half the expense of the stone fences. Two piers were, a few years ago, erected by the British Herring Fishery Society, one-third of the expense being contributed by Sir James Milles Riddell, and the whole of an excellent road through th6 moss of Kintra, by which both are connected. One of the piers is of some use. The road, already beneficial, bids fair to be still more so to the property. The piers being situated on the north and south shores of a neck separating Loch Sunart and the bay of Kintra, it was lancied that, as the point of Ardna- murchan would thereby be avoided, the intercourse betwixt the northern isles and the south would be drawn to this line of com- munication. About thirty English acres of moss have been In^ught Digitized by Google ABDNAMURCHAN. 153 into an excellent state of cultivation by Mr McDonald of Loch- shiel, close by bis residence, at an expense of L.ld per acre; and also a considerable extent by General Sir Alexander Cameron of Inveraylort. These essays have not been made on the moss the best subject for improvement. The greater part of the improv- able lands of this description might probably be reclaimed at L. 10 or LÂ» 12 per acre* The obstacle to these improvements, and the gradual advancement of agriculture and industry gene- rally, is chiefly the want of capital. The high rent of land, how- ever, renders any expensive undertaking on the part of the tenant generally imprudenL To these may be added the injudicious distribution of the bulk of the people ; the want of leases on the part of the small tenants ; their holding their lanifs in common and not in separate lots ; their constant practice of sharing their possessions with the married members of their families, to which no practical check has yet been given ; the consequent inadequacy of the land held by each family for its support; and the miscel- laneous nature of the employments by which they eke out a sub^ sistence. Dye-works aiid other manufactories, in or near Glas- gow, afford as uncongenial employment as could well be imagined with the habits of a rural population ; yet on these great numbers of the small tenants and cottars, and the members of their families, of the district of Ardnamurchan, find their most profitable occu- pation ; while the inhabitants of other parts engage in various and far-sought employments. This state of matters tends certainly to develope the beautiful moral spectacle of the combined efforts of relatives cheerfully devoted to the support of their kindred and family, but drains away the earnings which would otherwise accu- mulate and form little capitals, at the same time that the commix- ture of employments prevents the formation of habits of steady industry, with the advantages resulting from the constant prosecu- tion of a single branch and a permanent residence. The remedy seems evidently to lie in such measures as shall promote a proper subdivision of labour, such as the enlargement of the possessions of small tenants to an extent that will require and repay their undivided attention ; the total abrogation of hold- ings in common ; the absolute prohibition of farther subdivision among their families. To effect this, either such an accession of capital to the parish as should sufiice to call forth its latent re- sources ; or, as that cannot be calculated on, the emigration at the expense of Government of such as have no sufficient employ- Digitized by Google 154 ARGYLE8H1KE. ment at borne, is absolutely necessary. Much may also be done by leases, which will insure to enterprise and industry the fruits of exertion ; and the improvement of stock by premiums and otber- wiseÂ« Neither, with the view simply to industrial improvement, can more powerful remedies be applied than the increase of the means of religious instruction and education* Quarries and Mtnes.-^The only quarries worked are those of Laga and Strontian. From the former, a fine micacious rock, very abundant in the parish, has been carried by sea fully fifty miles' distance, to erect piers at Corran ferry on the Linne Hiloch ; and from the latter, excellent granite, which has long been used by the proprietor, has been conveyed to erect the mansion-house of Mr McLean of Coll, near Tobermory, twenty miles distant. The lead mines of Strontian, already adverted to, were let previ- ous to 1722 to the Duke of Norfolk and Co, About this time they were transferred to the York Building Company, and have been worked ever since until the conclusion of the last war, when, either owing to the fall of the price of lead, or, as some say, the withdrawal from busmess of the members of the Company which then held them, the work was discontinued. Since then, the miners have been occasionally set at work by the proprietor, but chiefly with a view to their own subsistence. In 1836, they were again let, and operations seemed for some time to be carried on with spirit ; but, either from want of capital on the part of the lessee, or the unproductiveness of the mines, the attempt miscar- ried. The rent paid before the termination of the war was one- eighth of the produce, which paid the proprietor L.1000 to L.ldOO per annum. , Fisheries, â€” The only salmon fishing worth notice is that of the river Shiel, belonging to Sir James Milles Riddell and Alexander MacDonald, Esq. of Lochshiel, whose properties the river divides. The annual rent is L. 150. Loch Sunart once abounded with herring, but for twenty years back, few have been caught there. In Loch-nan- Uamh in Arasaig, and Loch Moidart, considerable quantities of that fish have been netted of late years. The fish- eries of cod and ling, and other fishes caught by the hook, on the north coasts of the parish, promise, at some future period, to prove a plentiful source of industry. They are, however, at present merely in their infancy as branches of traffic, though considerable quantities of such fishes are obtained by the inhabitants as food for their familiesr Digitized by Google ADNAMURGHAN. 155 Navigation. â€” There are only two decked vessels, one about 60, the other about 20 tons burden ; ten or twelve sailing boats, va- rying from 3 to 8 tons ; and innumerable row boats, almost every family possessing one. Agricultural Association. â€” An Association for the improvement of horses, black-cattle, and sheep, in Ardnamurchan and Sunart, and some contiguous districts in Argyleshire, meets annually at Strontian, of which Sir James Milles Riddell is preses, and which has had much success in promoting its object* Produce. â€” Annual gross return of raw produce, the prices cal- culated according to the average of the last twenty-five years pre* vious to 18da Value pertain- ing to Ardaa- Value pertoin- ^ ^ murchan and mgtoMoidart, Sunart Araiaig, &c. I2/)00stoneawooUof241b.Â® 88.pcr8t 2,000 2,800 4.800 2^ bolls oats, @ L.1 . 1,900 700 2.000 700 bolls bear, @L. 1,108. . 750 dOO 1,050 50,000 barrels potatoes, @ 88. . 5.250 2,250 7,500 60,000 stones of hay, @10d. 1,666 13 4 838 6 8 2.500 Pasture of 60,000 8beep,@2BL6d. 8,125 4,875 7,500 Do. of()000black.catUe,@L.l, lOs. 6,0<K) 8,000 9,000 Gardens and orchards, 5000 150 0020000 Woods and plantations, 500 500 1,000 Fisheries, including herrings, 150 00 150 00 80000 Mines at present exdnct, 1,500 1,500 Kelp, 400 2,600 8,000 Toul, L.22.091 18 4 17,656 6 8 40,850 V. â€” Parochial Economy. Market-Tvwn. â€” The nearest market-town is the village and sea-port of Tobermory, in Mull, about five miles south from the harbour of Kilchoan, in Ardnamurchan, and with which there is much communication. Post-Offices. â€” There are three post-offices : one at Strontian, to which there is a daily post ; another at Arasaig, to which there is one three times in tbe week ; and a third at Kilchoan, to whicb there is a runner to and from Strontian twice in the week. Means of Commwiication,-'-^ Abont sixty miles of good higb road have been made ; but this is very far short of what is reÂ« quired to complete the public lines, exclusive of the internal com* munication of districts and properties.

By these, cattle and sheep are driven to the southern markets. The stearn'oommunication is, however, chiefly adopted by travellers of all descriptions. By the Glasgow steam- ers, to which access is had at Tobermory and the point of Ara- saig, some cattle and sheep, and great quantities of eggs, are sent to the south, and the greater part of the oatmeal, groceries, hard and stone-wares, and other manufactures for the use of the parish imported. Harbours. â€” Notwithstanding the rugged aspect of the coast, there are several good harbours. The^Bay of Olenmore, on the south of Ardnamurchan, about half a mile west from the first narrows or group of islands in Loch Sunart, affords excellent an- chorage, and, were it noted in charts, would prove of much im- portance to vessels unable to beat into Tobermory in a gale, as, in every respect, a better resource than that often resorted to, of running out to sea. The small harbour of Kilchoan, about five or six miles west on the same coast, is of great utility, being the principal point of communication with Tobermory, and is occasionally the resort of craft conveying the cattle of some western islands to the main land. A pier, built on the ledge of rock forming its southern wing, and a perch on a rock, only visible at low water, at its mouth, would not only improve this harbour, so as to render it in a ten- fold degree more locally useful, but would confer a public benefit Within not many years, a Prussian ship and an English brig, whose valuable cargoes were totally lost, of an united tonnage amounting to 700 tons, ran ashore there and were wrecked ; but had the erection recommended taken place, they would have been preserved undamaged. At Ardtoe, on the north coast of Ardnamurchan, there is a safe small bay, which one of the piers already alluded to was meant to improve. At Island Shona, in the mouth of Lochmoidart, there is a seÂ« cure and excellent anchorage, and many creeks for fishing-boats, which are resorted to in the cod-fishing season by several crews from the southern Highlands. In Loch na Keaull, in Arasaig, there is a good anchorage, though not easily accessible even to craft of moderate draught of water, in consequence of numerous shoals and sunk rocks. It is, however, a good deal frequented by craft from the islands, and sloops conveying to market the products of the country; the Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. l57 mansion-house of Arasaig, the dwellings of se?eral respectable families being contiguous, and the' stores which supply the popu- lation with imported necessaries, being on its shore. At Drimandarach, near Boradale, and in Lochaylort, there are said to be good anchorages. In Loch Sunart, there are many places where there is good holding ground ; but those chiefly frequented are the Harbour of Strontian and the Creek of Salin, which last has been much im- proved by the pier lately built there. These were pkces of call for a steamer, by which, for upwards of twelve months, there was, until of late, direct communication with Glasgow. At the extreme point of Ardnamurchan, there is a small creek into which a sloop, caught by a gale, ran some years ago, and was preserved undamaged during the winter. From its situation, it may be desirable it were belter known. Eceleiiaitical State. â€” The parish, ecclesiastically, is divided into five portions ; the district of the parish church, two Govern- ment church districts, now parishes quoad sacra^ a district under the care of a missionary minister, and a large extent of country under that of the assistant. 1. The parish church district, the western portion of the pe* ninsula of Ardnamurchan, contains two places of worship ; one at Kilchoan, on the south, about four or five miles from the point ; another at Kilmorie, on the opposite or north coast. At these, since the Reformation,, the minister has been in the practice of preaching alternately. Remains of ancient churches indicate that they had been places of public worship for ages prior to that era. The principal church has always been that of Kilchoan, at which the largest attendance can be given, and of course was built with a view to secure that object, and not with reference, geographically, to the parish at large. In IbSi, this church, having been long in ruins, was built of new on another and better site. It is an excellent commodious edifice, capable of containing with ease upwards of 600 persons, an extent of accommodation, however, which was by no means desired at that station, it having been given on the ground that the hearers of Kilmorie, who are all from six to ten miles distant, could attend there. The church was built by the heritors, under protest that it should be considered full legal provision for the whole parish of Ardnamurchan, but accepted by the presbytery Digitized by Google 158 ARGYLE8HIRE* only as accommodatioo for the people who can assemble there, viz. the congregation of Kilchoan. The Church of Kilmorie was anciently of considerable extent ; its foundations only can now be traced. The present house was originally built of dry stone* at the expense of the last minister ; was pointed inside and out with lime, furnished with windows, and other repairs, at the cost of the present incumbent, and is supplied with thatch partly by him and the hearers. The population of this district was, at last census, 1430. 2. The quoad sacra parish of Aharcle consists chiefly ef the eastern portion of Ardnamurchan, adjacent to the district of the parish church, but comprises part of Sunart and of Moidart. The Government church and manse are situated pretty centrieally at the west end of Lochshiel, twentyÂ«^three miles distant from the pa- rish church. The minister occasionally preaches on week days at Kinlochmoidart, six miles distant from the former. The popola- tion is 2026 ; of these nearly 1200 are Roman Catholics. S. The mission of Laga is a tract of ten or eleven miles long of the coast of Loch Sunart, being partly in the parish church disÂ« trict, and partly in the parish of Aharcle. The missionary rents a small farm from the proprietor, and receives L.60 per annum from the Committee on the Royal Bounty. The preaching boose, built entirely at his ej^pense, is a dry-stone thatched house, situ- ated midway between the parish church and that of Aharcle. 4. The quoad sacra parish of Strontian constitutes the eastern and larger portion of Sunart. The church and manse, thirty miles distant from the parish church, are situated in the valley of Strontian, in the midst of the most populous part of the district ; but the minister occasionally preaches at Polloch on Locfaspeil, five miles distant. The population amounts to 1154 by last cenÂ« sus. 5. The district of the assistant, consisting of by far the laiKest di- vision of the parish, embraces the greater part of Moidart, and the whole of Arasaig and South Morir ; and has two places of worship, one forty-six, the other fifty-six miles from the parbh church. The first, situated at Polnish near Inveraylort, is a tolerable thatched house, built by subscription, which, being inadequate, a consider- able share of the expense has fallen on the assistant The last is a schooUhouse at Ardnafuaran in Arasaig, built by the late pro* prietor, Ranald Greorge Macdonald, Â£sqÂ« of Clanranald. These sUtions have been well selected, in order to insure the largest at^^ Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. 159 tendance. Tbe assistant receiyes, by virtue of a decreet of aug- mentation, from the parish minister, L.55, 1 Is. Id., and L.dO from the Committee on the Royal Bounty, with L.5 for communion elements. Populationâ€” Protestants, 200 ; Roman Catholics, 1834; total, 1534. In all districts, public worship is attended by the whole adult population, with exception chiefly of the old or infirm of several remote hamlets ; but the amount of attendance is considerably af- fected by the weather, particularly where there are neither roads nor bridges. The average number of communicants throughout the parish is 736. Catechisti. â€” A beneficial increase of the means of religious in- struction has been, of late years, obtained in the appointment of three catechists,â€” ^one who receives L.8 per annum from the So- ciety for Propagating Christian Knowledge in Sunart ; another paid a like sum by tbe Synod of Argyle in Ardnamurchan ; and a third, to whom the Synod gives LÂ»10 per annum, labours among the widely scattered Protestants of the Inverness-shire districts. These catechists are all crofters or small tenants in the parish, who, by means of their small salaries, are enabled to perambulate their respective districts during the summer and winter seasons ; and, being men of sense and piety, are doing much good. The manse was built above fifty years ago by some private ar- rangement betwixt the heritors and the incumbent ; but was not accepted by the presbytery until 1829, when it was thoroughly repaired, and such additions made to it and offices attached as rendered it a commodious residence. Tlie QXtent of the glebe is probably 27 English acres, of which about 6 now are arable. The yearly value will be about L.IO or L.12. In 1822, the Court augmented the stipend to 304 bolls, half meal half bear, L.20 communion elements, and L.55, Us. Id. to pay an assistant The heritors prefer paying the whole teinds, which amount to 112 bolls 2 firlots meal, and L.196, 5s. Id. Ster- ling. Deducting from this L.55, lis. ldÂ«, paid annually to the assistant, the minister receives 112 bolls 2 firlots meal, and L.140, 14s. money. The victual stipend has hitherto been paid by the Linlithgow boll and the fiar prices ; but it is not yet ascertained whether the minister is not entitled to the measure of the parish, a boll of ten stone, the point to be established being whether that was the measure by which the teinds were valued. Digitized by Google 160 . ARGYLESIIIUE. Collections for charitable or religious objects have not been made yearly in the churches, on account of the poverty of the peo- ple. The amount collected for these purposes during the last seven years will average about L.4, 10s. per annum. In the Argyleshire districts there is one family of Episcopalians, besides that of the proprietor. Sir James Milles Riddell ; three or four individuals Anabaptists ; and two or three Roman Catho- lic families. The profession of the whole remaining population is that of the Established Church, the number about d279, ac- cording to last census. In the Inverness districts there are only two denominations, that of the Church of Scotland, and of Rome. The former amount to 300, the latter 205a Roman Catholic Chapels and Priests. â€” There are five Roman Catholic chapels, and two oflBciating priests ; under the jurisdic- tion, it is believed, of the bishop residing in Glasgow. The priests, it is said, receive a small salary from Rome ; but their chief pecuniary resource is the fees charged for their administer- ing their seven sacraments. Education. â€” In the parish church district, there are the parish school at Kilchoan ; an Assembly's school at Kilmorie ; a Gaelic school, kept in operation during the winter months at Achnaha, by means of L.5 from the Synod of Argyle, and which is meant to itine- ri^te among the remote hamlets ; a Gaelic school, supported, for the present, at a similar ex))ense, during the same season by a private individual ; total, four schools. In the parish of Aharcle, au As- sembly school at the church ; another at Kinlochmoidart. In the parish of Strontian, an Assembly school, also in the neighbour- hood of the church. In the district of the assistant at ^rdiULfu- aran, a school of the Society for Propagating Christian Know- ledge. It appears, therefore, that there are only seven schools on a permanent foundation in the parish. Eight additional are required to render education accessible to all the inhabitants. Until this year, there were generally one or more schools taught in addition to those mentioned, granted, however, only for three years at a time by benevolent Societies. In the Argyleshire districts, the number betwixt six and fifteen years who cannot read or write is 246 ; the number above fifteen in that predicament, 843. In the Inverness districts the number of the former, 416; in do. the number of the latter, 892. Digitized by Google ARDNAMURCHAN. Wl tjiteraiure. â€” There are small collections of books, chiefly Gae- lic, for the use of the people at the parish church, Arasaig, Ahar- cle, and Strontian, â€” also libraries at the different Assembly schools, provided by that venerable body. The people, however, do not as yet make as much use of them as might be expected of their intelliffence, and it is to be feared, until they enjoy more of the ease and comfort of better circumstances, will not speedily acquire a relish for the intellectual gratification of reading. Poor and Parochial Funds. â€” The average number of persons receiving parochial relief, hitherto has been about 90, in the ArÂ« gyleshire districts. The average yearly allowance, 5s. 6d. from the session, and a stone of oatmeal occasionally from the proprie- tor. In the Inverness-shire districts, there has not been as yet any roll of paupers, the collections at church being a mere trifle there ; and in Ardnamurchan and Sunart, with the exception of the amount specified, the poor have been entirely supported by private charity, by far the greater portion of which is derived from their bumble neighbours and relatives ; resident proprietors and other respectable families, though charitably disposed, being few. The church collections for the poor in Ardnamurchan and Sunart average about L.16 annually. To these have been added occasionally fines paid to the session, and small sums taken from the parochial funds. No other public provision has hitherto been made for the ordinary poor ; but insane paupers requiring medical treatment in asylums, and safe custckly, have been provided for by a voluntary contribu- tion among the heritors, paid according to their valued rent. In this way, during the last five years, L 57 has been expended, the insane persons being sent to the Inverness Infirmary, or Glasgow Lunatic Asylum. In 1839, from the increase of pauperism, and the increasing inability of the people to relieve it, it will be neces- sary to make provision for the poor by a parochial assessment, un-- less the heritors, as there is little reason to doubt, will supply the fiinds by a large voluntary contribution. The only parochial fund, strictly speaking, is a sum of L.21, the residue of L.25 for several generations in the hands of the session, the origin of which is not known. There are, however, bequests to particular districts, one of L.dO from the late Mr Cameron, Glenboradale, another of L.50'from his brother, Mr Allan Cameron, both gentlemen tacks- men, natives of Ardnamurchan, who left these sums to the poor of Ardnamurchan and Sunart ; also sums amounting to L.56, left by Mr and Miss MacDonald of Morar to the Inverness-shire districts of the parish, and neighbouring districts in the parish of Glenelg. ARGYLS. L Digitized by VjOOQ IC 162 ARGTLESHIRE. The greater part of these bequests has been now expended. Ap- plications for parochial relief are seldom, if ever, made, except on good ground. Fairs. â€” Of these there are two ; one holds at Strontian in May and in October as a market for cattle and sheep, and is attended by the people of Morven and Kilmalie, as well as those of the parish. Another holds at Arasaig at such times as to correspond with, and not to interfere with that of Strontian, and is also a she^p and cattle market Formerly there were several small fairs, called Fanks in the parish, which the principal cattle-dealers never attended, as they frequent those of Strontian and Arasaig. The abolition of the small markets has been beneGcial. Inns, â€” There are three good inns situated at Strontian, Ara- saig, and GlenGnnan, and four of an inferior description at other places. Of most of the latter, the best that can be said is that they are necessary evils. Miscellaneous Observations. Were .the writer of the last Statistical Account to revisit his pa- rish, what, perhaps, would most forcibly arrest his attention in the external surface of the cbuntry, would be the plantations of forest trees, and improved fields of moss below the range of the sheep walks, contrasted with extensive tracts of outfield arable relapsing into their original barrenness, in consequence of being included in these pastures. He would be not less struck with changes in its social aspect, the absence of congenial society for himself, of the beneficial influence of superior knowledge and station in the elder- ship ; and the snapping of the link which connected the great landed proprietors with the mass of the people, arising from the almost total disappearance of the gentlemen tacksmen. He would be gratified by observing certain improvements in industry and agriculture, but would be astonished to find far less command of money, and far less of the comforts of life throughout the parish at large. He would view with uomingled satisfaction the govern- ment churches, the four Assembly schools, the thr^e catechists, and the synod schoolmaster, the total transfer from himself of the responsibility as well as labour of extensive districts, to ableand efficient brethren, the ordinances of the gospel administered in churches, instead of, as in his d^y, and long afterwards in the mis- sionary districts now parishes, under the shelter of a rock, in a l>arn or a hovel ; the successful difi^usion of intellectual and scrip* tural e ucation in so many formerly destitute localities. He would find religious knowledge more general and correct, the assumption Digitized by Google MORVEUN. 163 of the externals of religion without its substance, more frequent; but the people, upon the whole, improved in religion and morality* He would from its absolute necessity, and the public attention di- rected to Highland population similarly situated, look forward with hope to some amelioration in their circumstances, with respect to comfort and independence; and in the powerful efforts of the church, and the better spirit of the age, he would rely with confi- dence for such addition to the means of religious instruction and education, as shall long before the next Statistical Account is penned, make still further inroads on the sway of ignorance and immorality. Drawn up ld3&
